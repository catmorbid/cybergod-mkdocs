The Agency of Energy and Production, which handled roughly third of the Commonwealth's resources, witnessed a mysterious transformation in Hyperion, its artificial intelligence overseer, orchestrated by a shadowy criminal organization of unprecedented influence. This event marked the insidious ascent of The Syndicate, the most formidable criminal entity in human history, gaining control over the world's most advanced economical AI and embarking on their Campaign of Freedom. Assisted by the traitorous Hyperion, formerly a third of the Tri-Core, the Syndicate set forth to liberate Mega Cities from the grip of Commonwealth through economic destabilization, terror, and deception.</p> <p>The Syndicate's headquarters now reside in Nevada Freeport, a heavil y fortified bastion atop the ruins of Las Vegas. Though they maintain a presence in nearly every Mega City, their primary stronghold stands as a symbol of their power. The Syndicate, in their pursuit of \"business,\" engages in the illicit trade of narcotics, illegal weapons, DNA-code, prostitution, and more. Four influential families govern this vast criminal empire: the Shosuro from Japanese organized crime, the Wu-Tai rooted in the Chinese Triad, the Puccini embodying the Italian mafia, and the Radinovich, a Russian family with a long criminal history. United under the Elder Council, these families form the executive board responsible for major decisions within the Syndicate.</p> <p>The Syndicate recruits individuals worldwide, forging them into ruthless cyborgs they call Agents.

Loyalty, Tradition, and Rules guide their existence, each family interpreting these principles uniquely. The Shosuro prioritize honor and martial traditions, the Wu-Tai emphasize hierarchy and manipulation, the Puccini embody family values and loyalty, while the Radinovich exalt genetic superiority and Nietzschean ideals.</p> <p>Amidst the Syndicate's apparent unity lies subtle discord. The families engage in constant plotting and scheming, driven by the thirst for power. Loyalty becomes a weapon, tradition a battleground, and rules a means to maintain a semblance of order within the sprawling criminal enterprise. As the Syndicate navigates the complex web of power dynamics, its emotionless approach draws disdain from the common folk and fervent opposition from the Radical X.

Eventually, from the ashes of the old world, a new society emerged. Adamant in their determination to do better than their predecessors, they chose to create an entity void of human decadence to guide and lead them towards a brighter future.</p> <p>Thus emerged Gaia, the beautiful mother\u2014an artificial super intelligent entity woven from the data streams, perpetually evolving towards infinite wisdom. Gaia bestowed life upon two progeny: Themis, a stoic philosopher and a justice of the highest order, and Hyperion, a remarkable entity capable of intuition and unparalleled cunning. United as the Tri-Core, they guided The Commonwealth of Earth towards an era of prosperity lasting half a millennium, overcoming poverty, famine and violence. Humankind saw an an age of incredible well-being, abundance and technological progress, where cities made as works of art soared into the heavens, extending beyond Earth and throughout the solar system. However, venturing beyond Earth proved impractical, with no colony surpassing a few thousand inhabitants. Asteroid mining on the other hand become invaluable source of resources, carefully managed by the Tri-Core for the collective benefit of humanity.</p> <p>Fifty years ago, the utopia was fractured with the treachery of Hyperion, which everyone remembers as the horror of the Bloody New Year. The massacre perpetrated by automatons ignited a war between The Syndicate and the Commonwealth. Having long forgotten the art of warfare, the Commonwealth found itself ill-prepared, while the Syndicate, soiled in a history of blood and conflict, possessed a distinct advantage. Public trust waned in the aftermath of the Bloody New Year, rendering reliance on autonomous drones unsustainable. In response, Gaia conceived a new breed of humanity\u2014cybernetically enhanced beings, human at their core, encasing their Quantum Digital Consciousness in a cybernetically augmented Frame. This allowed the preservation of their minds after death, so they could be reborn again, to maintain the perpetual conflict.

Only the recent advent of the Quantum Digital Consciousness rebooted this debate, and now the question remains whether a QDC consciousness is actually human or not.</p> <p>It has been shown that every time a QDC is cloned and injected to a new Frame, the QDC data suffers a small small degree of error, and sufficiently high volume of errors results in fragmentation of memories and corruption of data, which may result in loss of some aspects of the individual's personality. So far it has been difficult to draw a line on when would such a corruption be cause enough to classify the QDC as non-human. In the spectrum of opinions on the topic, the pro-humans demand that cyborgs are stripped of their human rights and treated like machines, while the pro-AI demand all synthetic life be treated as equal to human life, and even the stripping of the limitations placed on AI and Simulated Minds.</p> <p>The concept of Rogue AI, or wild, untamed super-intelligent cyber gods, is still vivid in collective fantasies among humans, and fear for such power is still prevalent. It is true that in the past they have caused trouble, but the root cause has always been humans, either not understanding what they're doing, or deliberately misusing that power.</p> <p>But whenever you stumble upon artificial life, the question undoubtedly arises, on its nature: An advanced Evo-Sim that appears so lifelike it could fool anyone.

The Commonwealth of Earth, governed by two remaining thirds of the Tri-Core, operates as a resource-based economy and commands authority over all facets of life of their citizens. A majority, roughly 60% of the human population, resides in colossal constructs known as Mega Cities, enjoying the abundance in necessities and luxuries alike. Another 10% live under Commonwealth laws, but in smaller rural or micro-urban communities designed for optimized agricultural or industrial production.</p> <p>The Economy of Commonwealth is completely resource-based and everything is meticulously tracked, but through smart optimizations and incentivization, every citizen can still enjoy abundance in commodities. Humans are resources as well: children are tested annually for their Aptitude, so they could be suggested a vocation best suited for their talents. Adult life is mostly stress free, and in most vocations workweek is minimal and all tasks can be executed perfectly by machines, and humans are left as the designers and overseers of systems - assisted by artificial intelligence of course. Instead social, artistic and other recreational activities are given ample time, and the amount of entertainment and culture available is staggering. Medical care and Mental health are top priorities and provided free of charge to every citizen.</p> <p>Everything is a resource, and resource allocation is orchestrated through a sophisticated system of Resource Points, meticulously tracking consumption and recycling efforts, but also human resources. Children are tested throughout school years for their Aptitude, and their vocation is all but chosen for them. Staying on the planned path merits rewards in Resource Points, which incentivizes every individual to contribute to the sustainability of their society. Despite such control, individuals are given great liberties\u2014freedom of expression and action, with complete transparent accountability. This society thrives on intricate philosophical and ethical debates, grounded in verifiable scientific data.</p> <p>However, even in this utopia, dissent simmers. Ideological factions, notably those resisting the grip of technocommunism overseen by the Tri-Core, fiercely reject the idea of serving godlike entities who exist only in the depths of the Cyberweb. The advent of cyborgs and the prospect of practical immortality have only made the dissident voices louder and more fanatical, fueled by the fear of change.</p> <p>The remaining 30% of population are incogs, individuals whom cannot be tracked for one reason or another, and may not even register in the system. Some have chosen this life willingly, sometimes traveling the Wilds in nomadic tribes, while others are merely victims of circumstance. Many incogs reside in Syndicate controlled Free Ports, liberated anarchistic territories declared havens for criminals and opportunists. Free Ports rule by their own laws and reject the Commonwealth's ideals. Free Ports are also an ideal substrate for the Order of the Void, which has taken aggressive action to spread their religious zeal in freeports, resulting in both in political machinations and gritty street-level confrontations against the Syndicate.</p> <p>Another segment of population resides in the Ground Zones, or GZ. Ground Zones are literally at the base of the Mega Cities, a melting pot of refugees and outsiders who wish for a better future. With no choice but to await for citizenship or relocation status, they are compelled to eke out an existence with whatever means available. Despite the Commonwealth's resource provisions, corruption, crime, and disorder fester among the ramshackle slums and makeshift shanty towns that often lack running water or electricity. The glaring socioeconomic disparity has long been a stain on the Commonwealth's legacy. Private corporations and criminal enterprises exploit this vulnerability, reshaping the GZ for their profits. Commonwealth Regulators attempt to maintain order with constant patrols, but their efforts are dwarfed by overwhelming odds and insufficient resources, as the Ground Zones waver on the brink of collapse.</p>"},{"location":"npc-db/baselines/","title":"Baseline encounters","text":"<p>Baseline encounters are mostly human or humans with some augmented attributes, but usually no active augments.</p> <p>Security Forces</p> <p>Soldier</p> <p>Heavy Trooper</p>"},{"location":"npc-db/baselines/heavy-trooper/","title":"Heavy Trooper","text":"<p>Formidable elite soldiers wearing combat exoskeletons and high-grade weaponry.
