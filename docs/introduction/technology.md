title: Technology Overview
---
The overall technology level is extremely advanced. It does not make sense to provide a comprehensive list, instead the following is a rough overview of key technologies. Game Masters can make their own interpretations and applications as they see fit.

### **Advanced Bio-printing**

Techniques to “print” organic tissues, organs, and synthetic meat using specialized biopolymers and cultured cells. Faster and more precise than full clone-vat growth, making it ideal for partial body repairs, organ replacements, and high-volume food production.

### **Bioframe Cloning**

Accelerated growth of complete living organisms from a DNA sample, typically reaching adulthood in about 18 months. Transferring a personality into a clone requires a **Cybernetic Brain** and **QDC** technology.

### **Cold Fusion**

Low-temperature fusion power for cities, starships, and large industrial facilities. Not miniaturized enough for personal vehicles, but serves as a main energy source for quantum computing, gravity repulsion infrastructure, and space travel systems.

### **Cybernetic Brain**

A biologically derived brain enhanced with neural implants, enabling direct **Cyberweb** connectivity, compatibility with **QDC**, and advanced augmentations. Essential for transferring a digital consciousness into biological or cybernetic frames.

### **Cyberweb**

A massive, evolving matrix of **networked quantum bio-computing** hubs. Allows near-instant global communication of small data (via **Quantum Communications**) but still faces bandwidth limits for high-volume data. Maintained by powerful AIs and semi-organic hardware.

### **Evolutionary Simulated Mind (EVO-SIM)**

Illegal AI grown via evolutionary algorithms, capable of developing genuine emotions and unpredictable cognition. Deemed too dangerous because it can evolve beyond its initial constraints, risking unregulated sentience.

### **FTL (Faster-Than-Light)**

Purely theoretical at present. No active prototypes exist, nor are any major projects planned. **Plasma Drives** and supportive infrastructure (e.g., Moon Gates) enable high-speed travel within the solar system.

### **Genetic Editing**

Permits targeted removal or repair of severe genetic flaws before birth. Advanced modifications for cosmetic or performance reasons are heavily restricted or outright illegal, though elite factions may covertly exploit the technology.

### **Gravity Repulsion**

Generates a gravitonic field to offset local gravity, enabling hover-cars, floating platforms, and ambitious architectural designs. Energy consumption escalates with mass, limiting feasible size. Typically combined with thrusters or jet propulsion for actual maneuvering.

### **Moon Gates**

Massive orbital accelerators built around planetary bodies (e.g., Earth’s Moon) to sling spacecraft across the solar system at high velocity. Dramatically reduces travel time and fuel requirements when used alongside **Plasma Drive** propulsion. Requires elaborate station infrastructure and constant AI oversight to operate safely.

### **Nano Medicine**

Microscopic robotic systems perform precise cellular repairs, from healing broken bones to neutralizing pathogens. Must be administered carefully to prevent immune rejection. Common in high-end hospitals for rapid recoveries and life extension.

### **Networked Quantum Bio-Computing**

Distributed quantum computing enhanced by organic components—sometimes even human brains as auxiliary processors. Provides enormous computational power for the **Cyberweb**, advanced AI workloads, and large-scale simulation projects.

### **Plasma Drive**

High-thrust propulsion for interplanetary spacecraft, providing sustained acceleration via superheated plasma. Often used in tandem with **Moon Gates** for efficient, system-wide travel.

### **Quantum Communications**

Utilizes quantum entanglement to transmit encrypted signals at near-instant speeds over large distances. Ideal for command/control data or live coordination. High-volume transfers still rely on more conventional (albeit extremely fast) data channels.

### **Quantum Digital Consciousness (QDC)**

A person’s psyche captured and stored on quantum servers, ready for transfer into a **Cybernetic Brain**. Overwrites any existing personality in the host frame. Commonly used by elite forces and in critical life-saving scenarios.

### **Simulated Mind (SIM)**

Artificial minds with realistic emotional behavior but strict upper bounds on self-improvement. Used in service industries, personal assistance, and entertainment. **EVO-SIM** variants are banned for surpassing these safety limits.

### **Stasis**

Cryogenic suspension maintaining bodies (or frames) in a minimal-activity state indefinitely. Used in emergencies and certain penal systems. Preserves tissue viability by slowing biological processes to a near-halt.
