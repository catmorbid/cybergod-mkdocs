title: Technology Overview
---
The overall technology level is extremely advanced. It does not make sense to provide a comprehensive list, instead the following is a rough overview of key technologies. Game Masters can make their own interpretations and applications as they see fit.

Personality cannot be implanted without using Cybernetic Brain and Quantum Digital Consciousness. Human clones are produced to function as Biological Frames as long as they are implanted with Cybernetic Brains. |
| Cold Fusion                           | Fusion Energy can be created in relatively low temperatures leading to compact fusion power.

| Evolutionary Simulated Mind (EVO-SIM) | Advanced lifelike AI built through complex evolutionary methods that mimic growth of personality and personal history and memories. Can produce AI that have capacity for emotion and learning, thus they could be considered sentient. Technology is illegal due to ethical considerations.                             |
| FTL                                   | Faster Than Light travel has been theorized, and viable concepts exist, but no one has yet created a functioning prototype, nor is one planned for in the immediate future.                                                                                                                                              |

| Quantum Digital Consciousness (QDC)   | A digitalized psyche that exists in deep storage in the Cyberweb that can be downloaded to a host Frame, overriding any existing psyche. Requires a Cybernetic Brain or similar support structure.                                                                                                                       |
| Simulated Mind (SIM)                  | Advanced lifelike artificial intelligence with built-in limitations to their ability to learn. Regular SIM cannot become sentient by current definition.                                                                                                                                                                 |
