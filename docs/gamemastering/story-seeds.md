### Story seeds
Listed below are some seeds or ideas for a story. You will find recommended factions listed to help pick the the ones suitable for your players. Mercenary factions generally fit in every scenario as they work for the highest bidder.

#### Raid

`ARC`, `Section 12` or `Syndicate`, `RadicalX`, `OrderOfTheVoid`

The team takes part in a huge raid to take down a large criminal element. The raid is led by an elite ARC strike team, and supported by ordinary Regulators and drones. Section 12 operators were involved in organizing the raid, so they might be present to see it through.

The most probable enemy enemy would be the Syndicate, Order of the Void or Radical X. You can also create your own criminal faction.

The raid was carefully planned for months, and now it's time to execute, but as they proceed something goes wrong...
1. The other side got tipped off. The traitor must be found!
2. Another faction intervenes, why?
3. Surprise! A bigshot is visiting the site. Attackers should prioritize their capture while defenders should protect them at all costs.
4. An elite enemy unit is present that makes the task extremely difficult
5. The defenders are retreating but the site is rigged to blow up! Attackers have limited time to find and disarm all the explosives.

For a longer story you can start way before the raid takes place and take part in planning the raid.

#### Terrorist attack

`ARC`, `Section12`, or `RadicalX`, `OrderOfTheVoid` 

A faction is planning public act of terror to destabilize the Commonwealth.

Commonwealth objectives
- Avoid collateral damage
- Neutralize the terrorist threat
- Protect critical objectives

Terrorist objectives
- Take hostages and wreak havoc
- Cause as much damage as possible
- Denial of Access
- Obtain critical objectives.

#### Augmented Serial killer

`ARC`, `Section12`

A serial killer is on the loose. This is normally CRA Regulator business, but you have reason to believe the killer is seriously augmented. Who do they work for, and what is their agenda? #Section12 may have interest in the case if targets are high-value VIP's or if they have a reason to believe the Order of the Void is involved, or some other strange things are happening.

Objectives
- Catch the killer
- Prevent further killings
- Find out who bankrolled their augments

#### Evo Sim Ascendance

`Cyberweavers`, `Section12`, `Syndicate`

An Evo-Sim, or an artificial intelligence created with evolutionary methods to mimic real memories and human growth, has been detected accessing Cyberweb freely without limitations. Evo Sims are regulated and must be contained and never have free reign in the Cyberweb. This can lead to full AI Ascendance, i.e. the spontaneous creation of a Super Intelligence. Evo Sims are designed to have human emotions making them unstable platforms for super intelligence, and without oversight such entities can be dangerous.

Objectives
- Track down the entity and contain their access to Cyberweb
- Find out who is responsible for releasing the Evo Sim and bring them in.

Syndicate or Cyberweavers may have different ideas for the Entity, but everyone recognizes that letting it have free reign in Cyberweb is dangerous and bad for everyone.

Maybe you can find a cool angle for another faction? Go for it.

#### Psionic Incident

`Section12`

A Spontaneous psionic incident has been detected. Section 12 is dispatched to find out the cause of the incident and contain it. Public safety is important, but the subject must not be harmed.

Objectives
- Track down and contain the subject
- Resolve timeline events for the incident
- Do not harm the subject

Other factions may have interest in the incident as well, but it is significantly more difficult for them to locate psionic incidents. Order of the Void is able to detect them to a degree and Syndicate might as well have such means. ARC may provide additional fire support, but Section 12 operatives should be leading the operation.

#### Bio Weapon Threat

`ARC`, `Section12`, `RadicalX`, `Syndicate`

An unknown bioweapon is loose on a Megacity or a Freeport. What is the weapon and who is behind it?
1. Nano Plague that targets specific DNA markers
2. Zombie Virus
3. Bio-engineered monstrosity
4. Genetically modified animals
5. Contaminated food products that cause mass hallucinations
6. An advanced designer drug that is highly addictive and highly lethal
