title: Upgrade Points
---
**Upgrade Points** can be spent to improve your Frame by improving [[frame#Attributes|Attributes]] and [[character-creation/augments/index|Augments]]. You can also choose to buy new Augments. [[arc|ARC]] also allows spending Upgrade Points to improve your personal CHAOS Mk.2. sidearm.
