title: Merits
---
Merits are used to measure how well the group did in their mission. Each Mission Objective is worth a certain amount of Merits.
- **Primary Objectives**: Critical to mission completion. 3 Merits on success, -2 merits on failure.
- **Secondary Objectives**: Important objectives, but maybe not critical to mission success. 2 Merits on success, -1 merits on failure.
- **Optional Objectives**: Bonus objectives that are completely optional. 1 Merits each, no penalty for failure.

Merits are marked on Merit tracker, which works much like Progression tracker. Once the you have enough points accumulated, you can exchange them for the corresponding reward.

| Merit Points | Rewards        |
|:------------ |:-------------- |
| 2            | Team Assets +1 |
| 4            | Influence +1   |
| 10           | Upgrade Point  |
