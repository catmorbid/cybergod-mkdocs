### Merits
Merits are used to measure how well the group did in their mission. Each Mission Objective is worth a certain amount of Merits.
- **Primary Objectives**: Critical to mission completion. 3 Merits on success, -2 merits on failure.
- **Secondary Objectives**: Important objectives, but maybe not critical to mission success. 2 Merits on success, -1 merits on failure.
- **Optional Objectives**: Bonus objectives that are completely optional. 1 Merits each, no penalty for failure.

Merits are marked on Merit tracker, which works much like Progression tracker. Once the you have enough points accumulated, you can exchange them for the corresponding reward.

| Merit Points | Rewards        |
|:------------ |:-------------- |
| 2            | Team Assets +1 |
| 4            | Influence +1   |
| 10           | Upgrade Point  |

#### Team Assets
Team Assets represent influence in the players' faction(s) and how much resources is the the faction willing to provide to the team. Team Assets are essentially a pool of points available to the team to utilize during tough situations. Everyone shares the team assets and everyone can utilize them, and it's up to the team to resolve usage of their shared assets. If someone wants to be the boss of the assets, everyone else needs to agree and so on. You don't need to know what assets your team exactly has, but you can instead spend a point whenever the situation calls for it.

Team starts with a number of Team Assets equal to `Number of Players + 1`. You can then consult the table below as to what kind of things the assets can be used at.

Certain assets require some degree of influence as well, represented by Influence Points.
