title: Merits
---
Merits are used to measure how well the group did in their mission. They are a measure of renown and prestige within their faction. Each Mission Objective is worth a certain amount of Merits. Merits are a fluctuating, temporary resource that is intended to be exchanged for assets and other resources.

- **Primary Objectives**: Critical to mission completion. 5 Merits on success
- **Secondary Objectives**: Important objectives, but maybe not critical to mission success. 3 Merits on success.
- **Optional Objectives**: Bonus objectives that are completely optional. 1 Merits each

Merits are marked on Merit tracker, which works much like Progression tracker. Once the you have enough points accumulated, you can exchange them for the corresponding reward.

| Merit Points | Rewards        |
|:------------ |:-------------- |
| 2            | Team Assets +1 |
| 4            | Influence +1   |
| 10           | Upgrade Point  |
