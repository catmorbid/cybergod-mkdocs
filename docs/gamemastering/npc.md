## Enemies and NPC's
During stories characters will likely encounter other characters, many of whom will oppose them in one way or another. You can use the following examples, or create your own.

### NPC stats
You can always create an enemy or NPC using the normal character creation rules, but it is fine to simplify the rules a bit. Minor characters presented in this section use the following set of simplified stats.

| BOD | REF | MND | CYB | Expertise        | Pools | Mitigation | Wounds |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--------------- | :---- | :--------- | ------ |
| D6  | D6  | D6  | D6  | Combat, Physical | 4/2   | 2/0/0      | 2      |

**Alternate Stat Block**

!!! info inline start "Alternate Stat Block"
	- **Body**: D6
	- **Reflex**: D6
	- **Mind**: D6
	- **Cyber**: D6

	**Expertise**: Combat, Physical
	
	**Pools**: 4/2
	
	**Mitigation**: 2/0/0
	
	**Wounds**: 2
	


**Tier** indicates a rough level of opposition. Higher tier characters can take more wounds and should have better equipment. The tiers are **Common**, **Tough** and **Elite**.

**Attributes** indicate the attribute die used for those characters.

**Expertise** is an array of aptitudes where the character is most experienced at, hence using their Primary pool.

**Pools** are listed as primary / secondary and indicate dice pools to be used when making tests. Primary pool is used when task falls within their Expertise, otherwise use the secondary Pool. Optionally you can decide they are inept at something and roll half secondary pool.

**Mitigation** indicates how many mitigation points they should have available. The values are noted in order of Soft/Hard/Ultra mitigation.

**Wounds** indicates how many slots they have for non-stopping wounds. Otherwise mark 1 wound for minor wound, 2 for major wound and 4 for lethal wound. For common tier characters Major Wound is a stopping wounds, but higher tier enemies may be able to withstand more punishment.

Use the following table to determine Wounds based on Body attribute and the NPC's significance.

| Body | Common | Tough | Elite |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| D6   | 2      | 4     | 6     |
| D8   | 3      | 6     | 9     |
| D10  | 4      | 8     | 12    |
| D12  | 5      | 10    | 15    |

**Energy** simply shows how many Energy Points they have for using active Augments. The rules are the same as for Player characters, so the Level of augment indicates the cost in energy.

**Augments** are displayed as separate block if the character has any.

**Attacks** are listed in separate block and shows a typical attacks and weapons used.
