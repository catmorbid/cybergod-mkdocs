title: Progression
---
As you play stories the characters will progress in their abilities. This progression is reflected by **Progression Points**, which are earned after each session. Mark progression points in the Character Sheet, and once you've gathered enough, you can spend some or all of them to improve your character.

Each game session should end with a short retrospective on how the session went. Have a free discussion, gather feedback and finally award Progression. Progression is freeform, but here are some suggestions

- **Session Participation**: Everyone  gets 1 Progression for participating the session
- **Danger**: If you were in serious danger, you get another point.
- **Intrigue**: Participating in high stakes intrigue is worth some progression
- **Humanity**: Character expressed their human side, taking into account their Engrams.
- **Mission:** When you complete objectives tasked to you, you gain 1 Progression for each Primary objective completed. See [[merits]] for more information on objectives.

Some things that should not be awarded:

- Random Violence
- Deliberately hindering or complicating team efforts, unless there is a solid cause.
- Taking all the spotlight. Everyone should have a turn to play.
