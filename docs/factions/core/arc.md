# Advanced Regulator Corps (ARC)

When ordinary Regulators of the *Core Regulator Authority* find themselves in a situation way beyond their league, they call ARC. ARC is the elite military branch of the commonwealth, with a direct line to **Themis**, the first child, a powerful Super Intelligent Entity, and one of the *Tri-Core*. ARC is a special-ops group who wield powerful cybernetic augments and top-grade weaponry. They are promoted from the best and most promising candidates among common Regulators and being offered a spot in the ARC is a matter of great pride. ARC's primary enemy is anyone aiming to harm the Commonwealth, but they especially despise the terrorists faction **Radical X**.

### CHAOS Mk.2


ARC do not have any unique Augments, but each ARC Regulator is awarded a highly-customizable high-tech sidearm, the *CHAOS Mk. 2 Assault Sidearm*, a select-fire fully automatic handgun with advanced recoil dampening that fires 10mm Caseless Adjustable Smart Ammo (CASA) and can be reconfigured in realtime to adjust for its user's needs thanks to highly advanced nano-tech design.

Each weapon is assembled by hand to their users' specifications, encoded with their bio-quantum marker so they and only they can use the weapon. The technology was designed by Gaia and Themis together and it is a closely guarded secret not available to other factions and extremely hard to reverse-engineer. Many have sought after it, but none have managed to obtain one.

    **ARC players** can select 1 Configuration and 1 Modification *or* 2 Configurations when starting play. They can spend **Upgrade Points** to further modify their weapon, allowing them to choose  any 2 options per Upgrade Point spent. The configuration determines the base stats of the weapon while modifications change the stats of active configuration. It might be a good idea to list each configuration as separate weapon. Their frames will always come with the latest model of their personalized custom-built firearm.
    **Base Stats:**
    **Range:** Short-Moderate, **Bulk**: 1 (sidearm), **Capacity:** Moderate
