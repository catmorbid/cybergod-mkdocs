# The Syndicate

A seismic shift in the balance of power unfolded decades ago, culminating in the harrowing remembrance that is the *Bloody New Year*, and altering the fate of the Commonwealth. The Agency of Energy and Production, which handled roughly third of the Commonwealth's resources, witnessed a mysterious transformation in **Hyperion**, its artificial intelligence overseer, orchestrated by a shadowy criminal organization of unprecedented influence. This event marked the insidious ascent of **The Syndicate**, the most formidable criminal entity in human history, gaining control over the world's most advanced economical AI and embarking on their Campaign of Freedom. Assisted by the traitorous **Hyperion**, formerly a third of the _Tri-Core_, the Syndicate set forth to liberate Mega Cities from the grip of Commonwealth through economic destabilization, terror, and deception.

The Syndicate's headquarters now reside in **Nevada Freeport**, a heavil
y fortified bastion atop the ruins of Las Vegas. Though they maintain a presence in nearly every Mega City, their primary stronghold stands as a symbol of their power. The Syndicate, in their pursuit of "business," engages in the illicit trade of narcotics, illegal weapons, DNA-code, prostitution, and more. Four influential families govern this vast criminal empire: the **Shosuro** from Japanese organized crime, the **Wu-Tai** rooted in the Chinese Triad, the **Puccini** embodying the Italian mafia, and the **Radinovich**, a Russian family with a long criminal history. United under the Elder Council, these families form the executive board responsible for major decisions within the Syndicate.

The Syndicate recruits individuals worldwide, forging them into ruthless cyborgs they call Agents. These specialists excel in espionage, assassination, and deception, donning finely crafted suits as they navigate a world of profit and loss. Loyalty, Tradition, and Rules guide their existence, each family interpreting these principles uniquely. The *Shosuro* prioritize honor and martial traditions, the *Wu-Tai* emphasize hierarchy and manipulation, the *Puccini* embody family values and loyalty, while the *Radinovich* exalt genetic superiority and Nietzschean ideals.

Amidst the Syndicate's apparent unity lies subtle discord. The families engage in constant plotting and scheming, driven by the thirst for power. Loyalty becomes a weapon, tradition a battleground, and rules a means to maintain a semblance of order within the sprawling criminal enterprise. As the Syndicate navigates the complex web of power dynamics, its emotionless approach draws disdain from the common folk and fervent opposition from the Radical X. Between internal conflict and external adversaries, the Syndicate stands on the edge of dominance and self-destruction.

The Free Ports have become symbols of the Syndicateâ€™s struggle, isolated and free, but under constant attack from the other factions. The Syndicate's armies of enforcers and hatchet men strive to maintain ruthless order, even as the Syndicate's influence wanes in the face of rising challenges.
