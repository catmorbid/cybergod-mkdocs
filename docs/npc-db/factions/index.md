# Faction Encounters
Faction operatives can easily be as tough as player characters, and encountering them during a mission is always dangerous. They use the same augments and same weapons as player characters do, and can be quite deadly.

### Order of the Void
Order of the Void do not have a Cyber attribute, and they cannot be cyberjacked.

Order of the Void encounters usually consists of 4-10 cultists, brainwashed loyally obey their leaders ( See [[#Security Forces]]), but lacking any formal training or even decent equipment. The cultists are usually led by a smaller team of Disciples, Paladins or Harbingers. The Blessed tend to be lightly armored, as armor often obstructs their transformation abilities, but they all have regenerative abilities to compensate.

### Atlas Global Defense Encounters
AGD mercenaries can be encountered guarding high-security locations and protecting VIP's. Their strict code of conduct prohibits them from engaging in any direct illegal activities, but while the optics claims they are squeaky clean, many individuals have known to be less restricted by any ethical constraints during their contracts.
