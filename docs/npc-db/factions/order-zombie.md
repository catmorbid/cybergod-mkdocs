#### Zombified Civilian
`Tough`
A poor civilian turned into a zombified husk blindly obeying a Harbinger's commands. They can use firearms if given one, but typically attack barehanded or using a blunt instrument. They are surprisingly strong, and don't seem to mind pain, but cannot function on their own. They can recover from this state if the Harbinger commanding them is killed to rendered unconscious.
