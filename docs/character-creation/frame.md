# Frame

Frame is the physical body that character uses as host for their consciousness. Consciousness is digital and if you die you can be *reborn* in another frame. You pick one frame from those available to your [[#Faction]], but you can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve it further. Factions provide the resources to you and are also responsible for your Upgrades.

## Attributes

Frame determines the character's attributes. Attributes are measured with a **Level** from 1 to 4 and each Level indicates a Die Size from D6 to D12. The average human has Level 1 attributes, i.e. a D6 in everything. If a frame is lacking any attribute, it cannot perform any related tasks.

> You can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve Attributes. Attributes cost **2 Upgrade Points**.

### Body

Body represents constitution, strength, fitness and athletic ability. Use Body to fight in close combat and perform tasks that require endurance, strength or athletic ability. Body affects many aspects of the character passively, although it might not be used in tests that much.

**Max Power** determines how much damage you can deal in close combat, indicating how many **Attack Power** effects you can take without harming yourself.

**Max Bulk** determines how much gear and armor you can carry without penalties. More info on [[gear]]

**Wounds Slots** determine how much damage your Frame can take before going down. Higher level Body helps sustain more damage and still remain functional. See [[combat#Damage and Mitigation]] on how wound slots work.

| Body | Description | Max Power | Max Bulk | Wounds Slots                         |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|

### Reflex

Reflex determines hand-eye coordination and reaction time. Reflex is used to react to sudden situations, evade attacks and make ranged attacks.

Reflex affects **Initiative** which determines how fast you can act when making a Conflicting test in combat. Read more on this in [[combat]]. At D10 or higher Reflex you also become **Ambidextrous** and can handle actions with either hand effectively. Without ambidexterity, you take a -1D penalty to using your off-hand, when relevant.

| ------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| D6     | Average     | 1          | No           |

| D12    | Superhuman  | 4          | Yes          |
