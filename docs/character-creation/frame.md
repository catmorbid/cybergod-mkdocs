title: Frame
---
Frame is the physical body that character uses as host for their consciousness. Consciousness is digital and if you die you can be *reborn* in another frame. You pick one frame from those available to your [[factions/index|Faction]], but you can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve it further. Factions provide the resources to you and are also responsible for your Upgrades.

## Frame Template

Each character can choose one Frame Template from those provided by their Faction. This is their baseline and they can then spend **Upgrade Points** to improve their **Attributes** and **Augments**.

!!! info Alternate Frames
	You can spend one (1) Upgrade Point to obtain an alternate Frame with total Upgrade Point capacity equal to your primary frame. You can choose which frame to deploy with on a mission.
	
	 In addition, some factions may provide the character a **Baseline**, an unaugmented bioframe for off-duty use. A Baseline is unremarkable and has D6 in all attributes and no augmentations.

### Upgrade Path

Upgrade Paths are a completely optional way of choosing upgrades. Instead of fully customizing your frame, you may choose to follow the default upgrade path defined for your Frame. Each Frame Template has a unique upgrade Path designed for an optimized role-specific build.

You may also wish to stray from the upgrade path every now and then, and that is completely fine. Consider the Upgrade Path a tool to help your decision making process.
## Attributes

Frame determines the character's attributes. Attributes are measured with a **Level** from 1 to 4 and each Level indicates a Die Size from D6 to D12. The average human has Level 1 attributes, i.e. a D6 in everything. If a frame is lacking any attribute, it cannot perform any related tasks.

!!! info Upgrading Frame
	You can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve Attributes. Attributes cost **2 Upgrade Points**. Upgrade Points can also be used to improve [[character-creation/augments/index|Augments]].

### Body

Body represents constitution, strength, fitness and athletic ability. Use Body to fight in close combat and perform tasks that require endurance, strength or athletic ability. Body affects many aspects of the character passively, although it might not be used in tests that much.

**Max Power** determines how much damage you can deal in close combat, indicating how many **Attack Power** effects you can take without harming yourself.

**Max Bulk** determines how much gear and armor you can carry without penalties. The [[gear|Gear section]] details the available gear you can have.

**Wounds Slots** determine how much damage your Frame can take before going down. Higher level Body helps sustain more damage and still remain functional. See [[docs/systems/combat/index#Damage and Mitigation|Combat section]] on how wound slots work.

| Body | Description | Max Power | Max Bulk | Wounds Slots                         |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| D6   | Average     | 1         | 6        | 2 Bruise, 2 Minor, 1 Major, 1 Lethal |
| D8   | Strong      | 2         | 8        | 3 Bruise, 3 Minor, 2 Major, 1 Lethal |
| D10  | Powerful    | 3         | 10       | 4 Bruise, 4 Minor, 2 Major, 2 Lethal |
| D12  | Superhuman  | 4         | 12       | 5 Bruise, 5 Minor, 3 Major, 2 Lethal |

### Reflex

Reflex determines hand-eye coordination and reaction time. Reflex is used to react to sudden situations, evade attacks and make ranged attacks.

Reflex affects [[docs/systems/combat/index#Initiative|Initiative]] which determines how fast you can act when making a Conflicting test in combat. At D10 or higher Reflex you also become **Ambidextrous** and can handle actions with either hand effectively. Without ambidexterity, you take a -1D penalty to using your off-hand, when relevant.

| Reflex | Description | Initiative | Ambidextrous |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| D6     | Average     | 1          | No           |
| D8     | Quick       | 2          | No           |
| D10    | Graceful    | 3          | Yes          |
| D12    | Superhuman  | 4          | Yes          |

### Mind

Mind determines intellect, cunning, awareness and focus. Mind is utilized to resist mental damage and is often used in many skill tests, but does not have any passive effects.

| Mind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| D6   | Average     |
| D8   | Smart       |
| D10  | Genius      |
| D12  | Visionary  |

### Cyber

Cyber determines the character's ability to interface with computers, hack devices, engage in electronic and cyber warfare and defend against cyber intrusions. It's more a measure of hardware and processing power than anything else, and a Cyber rating can be obtained by using external equipment.

!!! info The Cybernetic Brain
	A character must have a Cybernetic Brain to obtain a Cyber rating, which enables them to backup their QDC. On the other hand this also makes them vulnerable to [[cyber-warfare#cyberjacking|Cyberjacking]].

Cyber determines how many **Apps** you can have installed. Apps are your weapons when using Combat Hacks, but can also be spent on general purpose [[gear#Utility Apps|Utility Apps]]. Read more about uses on Cyber attribute on [[cyber-warfare|Cyber Warfare section]].

| Cyber | Description     | Apps |
| ----- | --------------- | ---- |
| D6    | Common hardware | 2    |
| D8    | Hacker gear     | 4    |
| D10   | Military Grade  | 6    |
| D12   | Supercomputer   | 8    |

## Energy

Energy is used to fuel Augments. Each Frame starts with Energy Level of D6. Energy is consumption based, so when you spend some energy, mark it down and make a [[core-mechanics#Usage Dice|Usage Check]] for Energy. If you fail, you take a point of **Burn**.

All spent energy is until current *burn level* is cleared at the end of the scene.

!!! example
	Boris burned a lot of energy during a tough fight and now has 4 points of Burn. At the end of the scene he has 9 points of spent energy, and with the burn he can clear it down to 4 points.
### Burn
Burn represents long-term, potentially hazardous strain on the entire system that can harm the frame or cause system shutdown.

Whenever you take a point of **Burn**, mark it down and make a Usage Check (D6): On failure, the frame will temporarily shut down for a moderate duration to protect critical systems from overloading.

You can force the frame to push through the shutdown, but this will inflict a Major Wound.

Burn also determines the usage level at the start of a scene and it can only be removed with proper rest and recharge.
