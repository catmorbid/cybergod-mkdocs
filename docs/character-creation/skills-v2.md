## Final Notes

- Each Skill pairs with the relevant **Attribute** to form a pool of dice, reflecting the synergy between learned expertise and innate or augmented ability.
- **Aptitudes** (Combat, Survival, Technical, Education, Social, Physical) provide a baseline for untrained attempts and group Skills thematically.
- Encourage **Cyber** usage in multiple scenarios (combat, social, exploration) by leveraging augmented capabilities.
- Keep **Mind** valuable for intellectual tasks but distinguish it clearly from direct cybernetic interfacing to ensure **Cyber** shines in its own domain.
