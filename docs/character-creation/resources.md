Resources describe the character’s personal assets. They are measured with a Usage Die from D6 to D12. Basic resources are:
- **RP – Resource Points.** Commonwealth equivalent of currency, measured in consumption and calculated value of physical resources. You can use RP in commonwealth area to obtain commodities and services. Over-consumption will reduce available RP.
- **QC – Quantum Crypto Currency.** Black market currency used in Free Ports, but also within black market in Commonwealth area. In street slang called “qubes” due to a common practice of storing them in secure polyhedral data storage devices.
- **Influence**. A measure of influence within your faction. Can be used to call for favors. Common usage is to exchange Influence for [[team-assets|assets]].

Other resources may exist, and they can be equally measured with dice from D6 to D12.

## Usage Check
When you spend resources, you need to roll your Usage Dice, which is the die associated with the resource. Each point of usage or **cost** indicates how many dice you need to roll. If you succeed, you mark down the usage on the resource tracker, but if you fail, you must either reduce the Usage Die size by one step or cancel the usage entirely.
