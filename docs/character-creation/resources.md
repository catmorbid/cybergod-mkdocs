title: Resources
---
Resources represent consumable assets such as various wealth, supplies or ammo but also more abstract resources like stress and influence.

When you consume resources, you mark down the consumption and then proceed to make a [[core-mechanics#Resource Check|Resource Check]] to see if you can manage the consumption. Different resources work in slightly different ways, but the amount of resources is always indicated by a **Resource Die**, which is either D6, D8, D10 or D12. Unless otherwise stated, a failure in a Resource Check will decrease the rating (Die) of the Resource by one step. Failing a D6 resource check might mean you completely run out of the resource. Consult your GM for more details.

**Character Creation** 
- Start with D6 in *Resource Points* or *Quantum Crypto* (your choice, but may be influenced by choice of Faction).
- Spend *Resource Benefits* from Faction [[persona#Rank|Rank]] to improve.
### General Resources
General Resources are various commodities you can spend to obtain other commodities, favors or privileges. They include Resource Points, Quantum Crypto Currency and Influence. You can write down other resources as needed.

**Resource Points (RP)** is a measure of Commonwealth standard currency, a fully digitalized, personal unit of consumption. Commonwealth is a resource based economy so consumption is rather based on resource availability and cost of production than arbitrary monetary value. Overconsumption may also increase the cost as Resource Points are tracked personally.

**Quantum Crypto Currency (QC)** is widely used throughout freeports and in black markets within commonwealth. It is often distributed in anonymized encrypted polyhedral storage devices small enough to fit in a pouch or pocket, and in that form can be used as the equivalent to “cash” or physical money. The shape of the QC storage devices has given it the nickname “qubes” and “dice”.

**Influence** is a measure of social wealth, respect and renown. It can be used to call in favors and influence outcomes of certain situations.

Other resources may exist, and they can be equally measured with dice from D6 to D12. Write them down as required. Not all games utilize additional resources. When you spend resources you roll their usage dice, including existing tracked usage.
### Ammo

When you use a weapon in combat, you need to track its ammo usage. Each weapon has its own Ammo Tracker on the Frame Sheet. Mark down how much ammo you used and make a [[core-mechanics#Resource Check|Resource Check]] after the attack using the weapon’s [[gear#Capacity|Capacity]] as the Resource Die. On failure, you are out of ammo and must spend an action and a use up a [[gear#Reloads|Reload]].
