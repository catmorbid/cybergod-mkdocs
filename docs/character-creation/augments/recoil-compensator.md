Favored by heavy weapons specialists, the *TITAN Recoil Compensation System* is a formidable augment built for a singular purpose: to wield massive super-heavy weapons intended for combat vehicles by a lone cyborg operator. The TITAN also helps greatly managing recoil with any weapons, reducing the need to rely on advanced error-prone targeting systems, and it can be utilized with physically weaker Frames as well to better manager recoil from automatic weapons.

**System**
+ **Activate:** Spend 1 Energy to activate for 1 round of combat
+ See Agument Level -specific benefits
+ **Synergy:** Anything that improve ranged combat prowess with full auto weapons or heavy weapons works well with TITAN.
