Favored by heavy weapons specialists, the *TITAN Recoil Compensation System* is a formidable augment built for a singular purpose: to wield massive super-heavy weapons intended for combat vehicles by a lone cyborg on foot. The TITAN also helps greatly managing recoil with any weapons, reducing the need to rely on advanced error-prone targeting systems, and it can be utilized with physically weaker Frames as well to better manager recoil from automatic weapons.

**System**
+ **Activate:** Spend 1 Energy to activate for 1 round of combat
+ See Agument Level -specific benefits
+ **Synergy:** Anything that improve ranged combat prowess with full auto weapons or heavy weapons works well with TITAN.
	+ [[gear#Weapon Tags|Weapon Tags]]: Full Auto, Double Hits
	+ Augments: [[smart-weapons|Smart Weapons]], [[targeting-system|Targeting System]]

### Level 1
Helps mitigate recoil when using standard weapons, compensating for weak physical strength.

+ **Recoil Compensation:** Decrease the effective recoil of any weapons by 1.
+ **Burst Control:** When Body rating exceeds the required Recoil, you gain +2D Bonus with ç weapons, instead of the normal +1D. *Hit Limit* for Full Auto weapons is increased to 6 Hits. This Hit Limit increase stacks with any other Hit Limit modifiers, such as [[smart-weapons|Smart Weapons]].

### Level 2
The user can wield very large weapons with ease and can manage the added weight better.

- **Very Large Weapons:** You can wield **Very Large** weapons as if they very normal Heavy Weapons (no increase in recoil)
- **Heavy Load (Passive):** Your Max Load is increased by 4. This is a Passive effect and always active.

### Level 3
The user can wield even bigger weapons and carry tons of heavy equipment.

- **Massive Weapons:** You can wield **Massive** weapons without increase in Recoil.
- **Super-Heavy Load (Passive):** Your Max Load is increased by 8 (including the benefit from L2). This is a Passive effect and is always active.
- **Burst Control Overdrive:** Spend 1 additional Energy to further improve your Burst Control: Gain total +3D with [[gear#Weapon Tags|Full Auto]] weapons when your Body exceeds Recoil; *Hit Limit* for Full Auto weapons is increased to 8 Hits. This Hit Limit increase stacks with any other Hit Limit modifiers, such as [[smart-weapons|Smart Weapons]].
