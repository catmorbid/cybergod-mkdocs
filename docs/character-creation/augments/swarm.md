Utilize a swarm of special micro drones to spread out and monitor large areas, or to harass, disrupt or attack enemies. Swarm persists for a Moderate duration or until destroyed.

### System

The amount of energy spent depends on the size of the Swarm you wish to create. The Swarm can affect environment physically with a Body attribute depending on the size of the Swarm, any relevant tests utilize Physical skills, as relevant. The swarm can be used to observe a large area, granting the user extended vision within effective radius, and may award a circumstantial advantage for any Alertness or Investigation tests

Swarm can be used offensively to attack targets inflicting DC `Size+1` Kinetic damage. 

Swarm takes -2 DC from conventional attacks and normal DC from AOE attacks, but it is vulnerable to EMP damage, granting +2 DC against it. EMP AOE attacks would thus inlict +4 DC, almost certainly destroying the swarm. If the swarm is spread out in large area, it may be difficult to attack and on lethal hit you can simply reduce the size of the swarm as appropriate.

| 1     | Max Swarm Size 1. Long Range.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2     | Max Swarm Size 2 (Body D8). Extreme Range. Swarm can attack individual targets, ignoring all armor and cover that is not Sealed or Vacuum proof to automatically inflict damage at DC equal to Swarm Size. |
| 3     | Max Swarm Size 3 (Body D10). Extreme+1 Range. Swarm can self-destruct inflicting Explosive or EMP damage with DC of Size+1, AOE-M.                                                                         |
