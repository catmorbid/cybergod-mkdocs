A system for manufacturing and coordinating an army of nanites (or Biomorphs) programmed to repair physical damage. Regeneration is extremely rapid and may induce stress on anyone not accustomed for such sights. The process is incredible, and extremely painful, and built-in safeguard ensure that the user does not collapse due to shock when the process is active, hence the augment has high reliance on the user’s fortitude and pain threshold, and does not require much medical know-how otherwise, although skilled individuals may attempt hacking or controlling their augments to produce unorthodox effects.

**System**
- Spend 1 Energy to Activate as an Instant Action
- **Regeneration Test**: Make an `Easy Toughness x Cyber` test upon activation and spend Effect Points according to options available at your Augment Level.
- **Passive Regeneration:** Your natural wound recovery rate without any medical assistance is doubled. You will naturally heal any scar tissue, skin conditions and other superficial markings. This also includes tattoos, piercings and other skin modifications. A Bioframe will also negate effects of alcohol and other intoxicating substances and poisons up to four times faster than normal. You may attempt to control your passive regeneration with a `Med Tech x Cyber` and the effects will last for a Long duration, and may not be reattempted until effects have returned to normal. GM will set the difficulty for the test accordingly.
- **Body Modification:** You can attempt a **Hard** `Hacking x Body` test to try and force the augment to regenerate changes that do not fit the standard template, such as growing extra limbs, a fur coat or a longer hair. The effects can be made permanent if you gain enough successes (subject to GM call).

- **Regeneration Test Effects**
	- **[Biotech, Nanotech] Regrowth (3)**: Rapidly regenerate any limbs that have been severed or destroyed. Cybertech limbs are too complex to regenerated with specialized medical nanites, so unfortunately a Cybertech Frame cannot use this Effect.
	- **Repair Armor (5)**: Repairs 1DR worth damaged armor. Armor can be integrated like [[cybernetic-armor|Cybernetic Armor]], [[biomorph-armor|Biomorph Armor]] or any worn suit of armor. As long as it isn’t damaged, it can be repaired.
