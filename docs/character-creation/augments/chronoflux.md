> _“Time is a straight line—until you twist it into a knot and try not to strangle yourself in the process.”_
>—Syndicate Leader Researcher Dr. Matsumoto Goro, Chronoflux Project


An **Unsafe** and outright **Dangerous** modification to the frame’s Energy Core that manipulates local spacetime around the user. While it can grant **hyper-accelerated actions** or **temporal stunts**, each use risks severe harm—physical **temporal backlash**, meltdown checks, or permanent timeline scars. At higher levels, you can produce near “time-stop” effects, but you teeter on the brink of catastrophic paradox.

**System**
- **Activate**: Spend 1 Energy as an Instant Action
- **Maintain:** Chronoflux must be re-activated each round to avoid **Chrono Crash**
- **Chronoflux Test:** Test `Troubleshooting x Cyber` upon activation and spend Effect Points to gain Chronoflux Effects based on the augment’s Level. Chronoflux Effects *are not repeatable*, but you can pick more than one effect. Pay mind that each Effect also comes with specific **Complications** that you may wish to overcome by spending additional EP.
- **Chrono Crash:** Once you stop using Chronoflux (don’t activate it for another round), you face a “time-lag” that scales depending on the magnitude of the powers used.
- **Resource: Chronostasis:** Write down a new Resource named **Chronostasis** that starts at D10. High Level effects consume Chronostasis and trigger a Chronostasis Check, as a standard Resource Check. On failure, you will trigger a **Paradox** and must roll D12 on the *Paradox Fallout Table* as well as degrade Chronostasis by one step. Chronostasis improves naturally over time as long as you do not use Chronoflux, but the higher the resources, the longer it takes to improve. If Chronostasis triggers Paradox at D6, the rolled event from *Paradox Fallout Table* effect is permanent, but all consumption is cleared. Repeated permanent paradoxes may result in catastrophic disruption of the space-time continuum causing a massive scale Paradox (subject to GM discretion)
	- D6 → D8 in 48 hours
	- D8 → D10 in 2 weeks
	- D10 → D12 in 3 months

### Level 1
Small pockets of temporal distortion. Each time you do a Chronoflux Test at Level 1, you can buy the following Effects with your Effect Points. Each has **Complications** to address.

- **Fast Action (1)**: Gain an additional Action this round.
	- **Temporal Strain (1):** You take 1 wound without chance for Soak (Complication).
	- **Flicker (1):** Your Initiative for this round is at -1 (Complication).
- **Temporal Dodge (1):** Impose -2D penalty against one incoming enemy attack this round, as you briefly glimpse “ahead of time”.
	- **Micro Paradox (1):** Consume 1 point of **Chronostasis** risking **Paradox** (Complication).
	- **Time Blur (1):** Suffer -1D on your next **Reaction** as your vision lags behind normal speed (Complication).
- **Blink (1):** You can cross a **Moderate** distance in an instant violating laws of physics, passing through air with ease. You cannot pass solid obstacles, but you can go anywhere with clear line of sight.
	- **Temporal Nausea (1):** You feel extremely disoriented as your senses quickly revert to realtime and take a -1D penalty on any Reflex tests for the rest of the round (Complication).
	- **Temporal Strain (1):** You take 1 wound without chance for Soak (Complication).
- **Minor Chrono Crash:** After ending Chronoflux with only using Level 1 Effects, you have -1D on Mind and Reflex tests for 1 round as your senses take time to adjust back to reality.

### Level 2
You refine your temporal manipulation—multi-action surges, short rewinds, and moderate time manipulation. Each Distortion is costlier and triggers bigger complications.

- **Multi-Action Surge (2):** Gain 2 additional Actions this round. Alternatively, if you extend your time bubble to cover an adjacent ally, you can give 1 additional Action to both.
	- **Temporal Strain (1):** You take 1 wound without chance for Soak (Complication).
	- **Micro Paradox (1):** Consume 1 point of **Chronostasis** risking **Paradox** (Complication).
	- **Lag Echo (1):** You lose 1 Action *next* round as your timeline “catches up” to you (Complication).
- **Time Skip (1):** You attempt to push a target’s turn until the end of the round or skip their turn entirely. Target must make a **Moderate** `Toughness x Reflex` test with Complication **Action Delay (3)**; on failure they must skip their entire turn, but triggering the Complication they must act last.
	- **Synch Disruption (1):** Time Skip leaks to your own Bubble and your next test has a -1D penalty (Complication).
	- **Paradox (2):** Consume 2 points of **Chronostasis** risking **Paradox** (Complication).
- **Rewind Glitch (1):** You or a chosen Ally can re-roll a any one failed test this round
	- **Memory Loop (1):** You you must re-roll all dice on the affected test with -2D penalty (Complication).
	- **Paradox Chain (1):** Your manipulation of space-time immediately cascades into a minor Paradox: Roll 1D6 on the *Paradox Fallout Table* (Complication).
- **Moderate Chrono Crash:** If you used any Level 2 Effects before ending Chronoflux, you suffer a -2D penalty on Mind and Reflex tests for 1 round and -1D on the following round as you suffer minor temporal aftershocks. Re-activating Chronoflux to circumvent these effects results in one point of **Burn** and a D6 roll on the *Paradox Fallout Table*.

### Level 3
Nearly unstoppable time-warp feats that compromise the stability of space and time. The user effectively skirts the edge of reality, risking major paradox and Energy Core meltdown.

- **Godspeed Surge (3):** You gain 3 additional actions and are able to extend your bubble to up to two adjacent allies. Distribute additional actions between you and affected allies as you see fit.
	- **Massive Strain (2):** You suffer 2 wounds, unaffected by **Soak** (Complication).
	- **Paradox (2):** Consume 2 points of **Chronostasis** risking **Paradox** (Complication).
	- **Temporal Shockwave (1):** You and anyone in **Short** range takes 1 wound ignoring **Soak** (Complication)
- **Time Stop (4):** Create a small zone with a **Short Radius** within **Moderate range** from you. Anyone inside the zone is unable to take any actions unless they pass a **Very Hard** `Toughness x Reflex` test.
	- **Timeline Tear (2):** Immediately roll D8 on the *Paradox Fallout Table* (Complication).
	- **Energy Drain (2):** Immediately use additional 2 Energy and make an Energy Check to avoid Burn.
- **Timeline Rewrite (4-6):** Undo a major event that recently happened (e.g. an ally died or suffered a mental breakdown). Base cost is 4 if it happened this round, and is increased by 1 for each round that has passed since the event happened. GM decides the how much the rewrite affects the present.
	- **Gigantic Strain (2):** You suffer 3 wounds, unaffected by **Soak** (Complication).
	- **Major Paradox (3):** Consume 3 points of **Chronostasis** risking **Paradox** (Complication).
	- **Lingering Echo (2):** A lasting timeline anomaly is created. Roll on the *Paradox Fallout Table*, or let GM be creative (Complication).
- **Major Chrono Crash:** Ending Chronoflux after using any Level 3 Effects imposes a **-2D** penalty on **all** actions for the remainder of the scene, plus **-1D** in the following scene. If you re-activate to avoid the crash, you take a point of **Burn** and must roll D8 roll on the *Paradox Fallout Table*.

### Paradox Fallout Table
Roll on the Paradox Fallout Table whenever called for as a consequences of using Chronoflux, or when you fail **Chronostasis Check**.  

| D12 | Paradox Fallout      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Temporal Flicker     | The user flickers in and out of existence, appearing as ghostly echoes for a few seconds. The user gains **-2D** to all actions for 1 round as they phase erratically. Any attacks against them also have **-2D** penalty for that round because they’re half intangible.                                                                                                             |
| 2   | Local Time Bubble    | A localized bubble of sped-up or slowed-down time envelops a small area. Everyone in the affected area except the Chronoflux user is must pass a **Moderate** `Toughness x Reflex` test or skip their turn. The user however takes a wound and -1D penalties to every action this round.                                                                                              |
| 3   | Echoes of Future     | Fragments of near-future events bleed into the present. The user (and possibly allies) see glimpses of events _about to happen_. The Cyborg’s next action this round is with +1D advantage but the following action after that is with -1D penalty. Everyone takes 1 Stress.                                                                                                          |
| 4   | Doppelganger         | An alternate timeline version of the user briefly materializes—either hostile, neutral, or incomprehensibly confused. It is an equal duplicate in stats and abilities as the character, but their personality and reactions is entirely up to the GM. The doppelganger remains in the scene until GM decides otherwise. Roll a die for a random chance, or simply decide the outcome. |
| 5   | Environmental Warp   | The local environment warps—floors buckle or walls ripple like liquid. All terrain within Moderate distance has **Difficult Terrain (2)** trait, which is applied as a Complication to any Mobility tests through the terrain. The effects last for a few rounds (GM’s discretion).                                                                                                   |
| 6   | Chronal Burn         | A sudden feedback surge scorches the user, leaving sizzling arcs of temporal energy. The Cyborg takes 1 Burn or 2 wounds (their choice) and anyone within moderate distances takes 2 Shock.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7   | Memory Fragmentation | Anyone within Moderate distance suffers from temporal amnesia, mixing up events from alternate timelines. Everyone takes 2 stress and -1D penalty on any Mind tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 8   | Personal Age Flux    | The cyborg physically ages or de-ages a few years in an instant, hair color shifts or wrinkles appear/disappear, metal shows wear and tear or rust – or becomes amazingly clean and polished. Take 1 stress and  -1D penalty on Body for the remainder of the scene.                                                                                                                  |
| 9   | Spatial Dislocation  | The cyborg is suddenly teleported a Moderate distance in a random direction. They suffer 1 stress and -1D penalty on Reflex and Mind tests due to disorientation for 1 round.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10  | Timeline Merging     | Briefly, two timelines collide. Observers witness overlapping “versions” of everything for a heartbeat—furniture, enemies, your own body. Everyone present in the scene takes 2 Stress and -1D penalty Perception or Logic-based tests for the rest of the scene. Activating Chronoflux again will inflict Energy Burn.                                                               |
| 11  | Universal Observer   | A cosmic entity watches from beyond the fabric of time and space, marking the character for future observation. No immediate consequences, but the entity takes interest and may make an appearance at any point.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12  | Dimensional Rift     | A chaotic rift of fractal anomalies forms nearby. Anyone within Moderate radius takes 3 stress and 3 wounds each round (ignoring soak) and are tossed several meters in a random direction. The rift lingers until the end of the scene, then disappears, leaving behind a wake of destruction and a plethora of minor temporal anomalies.                                            |
