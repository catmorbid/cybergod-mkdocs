Enables extremely high damage and precision in combat by extreme calculation power, which is displayed as slowed down time and trajectory tracking. Effective in both close combat and ranged combat.

**System**
- **Activate:** Spend 1 Energy to activate as an Instant Action
- **Close Combat:** Test `Fighting x Cyber`
- **Ranged Combat:** Test `Aim x Cyber`
- See Level-specific effects

### Level 1
Gain the following benefits from targeting assistance and slowed perception of time:

- **Combat Awareness**: Slow perception of time, gaining better chance to score a successful hit. Gain one free re-roll on attack tests and general combat awareness tests
- **Enhanced Targeting**: Use predictive algorithms to highlight optimal Aim Points to hit vulnerable locations. Reduce Effect Point cost for **Weak Spot Hit**, **Critical Hit** and **Disarming Hit** by one.

### Level 2
Unlocks new **Effects** for both ranged and close combat.

- **Ranged**
	- **Trick Shot(2):** Upgrade a Hit. Ricochet the projectile at an angle to hit a target normally not in line of fire, to e.g. ignore a cover. You can stack **Trick Shot** to implement more complex Trick Shots that ricochet from multiple points. Laser weapons can ricochet if a reflective surface is available, and Plasma and Gauss weapons can only ricochet if a powerful force field (such as Aegis augment) is nearby. GM can decide how complicated a Trick Shot would be, indicating how many Trick Shot effects are required to succeed. The complexity is very circumstantial.
- **Close Combat**
	- **Nerve Point (2):** Upgrade a Hit. +1 DC and AP. If you inflict at least one Wound, you may apply any of the following conditions: **Bleeding**, **Stunned**, **Blinded**, **Deaf**, **Unbalanced**, **Crippled**.

### Level 3
Unlock the following benefits

- **Motion Vector Compensation**: Ignore up to 3 penalty dice on Attack Test due to targetâ€™s velocity or Evasive action through Mobility Tests.
- **Awareness Overload**: You can spend any number of additional energy to gain re-rolls on Attack tests and general combat awareness tests, unless you become **Overloaded** due to **Burn**.
