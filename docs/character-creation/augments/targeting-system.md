### Targeting System

#Cybertech #Nanotech 

Enables extremely high damage and precision in combat by extreme calculation power, which is displayed as slowed down time and trajectory tracking. Effective in both close combat and ranged combat.

Using Targeting System costs 1 Energy, but you can keep spending Energy after the first re-roll to gain further re-rolls, up to the limit indicated by Augment Level.
