The Gravitron is a powerful augment that can be used for manipulating and altering gravity.

| Level  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | **Nullify Gravity**: Close -> Short -> Moderate radius. Counteracts gravitic forces within the specified area. Everything floats as if in micro gravity. Short->Moderate duration.                                                                                       |
| 1      | **Gravity Punch**: Pinpoint gravity to a small area, magnifying striking power when fighting unarmed. Improves unarmed DC by +1 -> +2 -> +3 for an Instant -> Short -> Moderate duration.                                                                                |
| 2      | **Lift**: You can slowly repulse gravity to lift everything within Close -> Short -> Moderate radius centered on you, enabling a slow levitation effect. Affects everything within the radius for Moderate duration.                                                     |
| 2      | **Impulse**: Generate a momentary impulse of force to move yourself, or to push targets back. When pushing a target they must make a Body Save 4 -> 5 -> 6.                                                                                                              |
| 3      | **Immobilize**: Pin targets at Short -> Moderate range to the ground by amplifying local gravity, making them extremely heavy. Targets may attempt to resist by making Body Save 4 -> 5 -> 6.                                                                            |
| 3      | **Barrier**: Generate a brief but powerful force field in one direction at approximately 90->180->270 degree arc that nullifies all kinetic forces that collide with it. Stops anything with a kinetic force, including bullets. Lasts for an Instant -> Short Duration. |
