### Drone Eyes

#Cybertech 

A modified ocular system which has an array of multiple *Ocular Drones* that can be launched independently to provide visual coverage of a large area. The image of all the drones is combined in real-time to a visual matrix combined from the image of all the drones.

| 1     | **Quad Array**: Four ocular drones which either add a combined +1D to Alertness tests, when mounted in the Ocular Array, or can be launched independently to provide large area coverage. Long Range.           |
| 2     | **Hexagonal Array**: Six ocular drones which either add a combined +2D Alertness when mounted in the Ocular Array, or can be launched independently to provide large area coverage. Extreme Range.              |
| 3     | **Octagonal Array**: 8 ocular drones which either add a combined +3D Alertness when all drones are mounted in the Ocular Array, or can be launched independently to provide large area coverage. Extreme Range. |
