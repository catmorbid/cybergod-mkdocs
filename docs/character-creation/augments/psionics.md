Unlock psionic abilities in the human brain. 

## System

To use Psionics you need to spend 1 Energy per level of psinoic ability. In addition you must make a **Psionics test** using `Current Resolve + Psychology x Mind`. If you fail, you take a point of intrinsic stress.

**Psionics Boosting**: You can spend extra energy to Boost various properties of abilities, but you can also spend any bonus Effects from the Psionics test in similar manner.

You can use any abilities at your Psionics Level.
