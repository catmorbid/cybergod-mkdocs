>“The PSI-Net is not a place, but a tapestry woven from every mind that has ever lived—pull one thread, and the entire weave trembles.”
—Dr. Isobel Kagura, Project Mind’s Eye

Unlock psionic abilities in the human brain. Psionic augment enables the user to sense **Psionic Resonance** in all all things – living or inanimate – to manipulate and control it. By harnessing Psionic Resonance, the user is capable of incredible feats of supernatural prowess. At the same time, they are dealing with experimental and theoretical technology that deals with strange, exotic force – and by doing so, each action comes with inherent risks.

Psionic augments come in three different varieties, each focusing on specific type of Psionic Resonance manipulation.

- **PSI-Cognitive Resonator** enables focus on sensing, manipulating and controlling psionic resonance produced by thoughts of living beings. They can sense the *consciousness*, allowing them to can read minds, produce illusions, force suggestions and even control minds.
- **Psychokinetic Amplifier** allows the user to detect and sense ambient resonance in physical world and by manipulating it they can exert force on the physical realm.
- **ESP Modulator** allows mastery of the **PSI-Net** – a web of connections between all psionic resonance. Commonly called ESP or Extra-Sensory Perception and it enables to user to reach vast distances in their mind’s eye, predict outcomes from chaos and read fine-grained resonance from objects, marking their *history*, essentially sensing past events.

Section 12 is the only proprietor of Psionic augments and while other applications may be possible to develop, they have focused on these three as the most beneficial for their operatives.


## General System
All three PSI augments follow similar general rules.

- **Activate:** Spend 1 Energy to activate the augment and make a **PSI Test** as an **Instant Action**.
- **Maintain:** Some effects can be maintained. Unless another test is required or you wish to make another test, you can maintain effects by spending 1 Energy per round of Combat. In non-combat scenes many effects can be maintained indefinitely, but GM may call for further energy use at suitable intervals. You must always spend energy to maintain effects between scenes. Usually another test is required as well.
- **PSI-Test:** Test `Resolve x Mind` — Psionics relies on willpower and robust mental talent and it is shown to be most potent in uncorrupted “clean” minds; that is to say, the augments’ strength relies on the *humanity* and *determination* of their wielder.
	- Spend **Effect Points** on available Effects according to Augment Level. Some high-level augments may have linked **Complications** that need to be overcome to not suffer the consequences.
	- **Effect: Potency (1):** Repeatable. All Psionic Effects have a basic various properties, such as *Damage Class*, *Duration* or *Range*, which can be boosted by taking the Potency effect. Modifiable properties are noted with an arrow, e.g. “**DC 1** → **DC 2**” means one Potency effect can improve Damage Class of from DC 1 to DC 2, and likewise a chain of arrows means you can boost the potency of that property even further. If properties of combined Effects are in conflict, simply use the highest property on each. E.g. a **Moderate** radius effect and a **Short** radius effect results in combined **Moderate** radius effect. Each Potency Effect can only affect single property. You can take as many Potency effects as you need.
	- **Multiple Effects:** You can combine any available Effects in a single PSI-Test, as long as you have enough Effect Points available, and the combination makes some sense (GM fiat). E.g. You can combine *Kinetic Force Impulse* with *Pyrokinesis* to create a powerful force impulse that lights things on fire.
- **Concentration:** PSI-user can spend up to *three* Actions on Concentrating before making the **PSI-Test**, each action granting +1D bonus on the **PSI-Test.** Spending 2-3 actions on concentration means the actual **PSI-Test** is made on the following round. This bonus stacks with any bonuses to Mind tests and can exceed the normal +3D limit on Bonus Dice.
	- **Interruptions:** If you take damage or are affected by any kind of mentally or physically disorienting effect, you need to make a **Moderate** `Toughness x Mind` Test to maintain concentration. If you fail, you lose all concentration gained so far.
- **Psionic Echoes**: Every time psionic resonance is manipulated, it creates an “echo” in the **PSI-Net**, an interconnected hyper-dimensional psionic network. Most of the time nothing special happens, but *sometimes* there is a response. The theory is that some kind of naturally PSI-sensitive beings exist that are capable of sensing these “echoes”, and the stronger the psionic effect, the more likely it is for such an “echo” to manifest. When called for, roll or consult the *Psionic Echoes Table*.
- **Resource: PSI Integrity:** Write down a new Resource “PSI Integrity”, starting at D10. PSI Integrity determines how stable your relation is to the **PSI-Net**, and the lower it is, the more likely it is for you to generate *echoes*. PSI Integrity may be consumed by using high-level augments, in which case you need to make a standard Resource Check, and on failure, you must roll D12 on the *Psionic Echoes Table* as well as degrade the resource by one step. PSI Integrity improves naturally over time, as long as the user refrains from consuming any PSI Integrity.
	- D6 → D8 in 48 hours
	- D8 → D10 in 2 weeks
	- D10 → D12 in 3 months

## PSI-Cognitive Resonator
Unlocks the ability sense Psionic Resonance generated by *living beings*, *conscious minds*, *thoughts and emotions*. Each Level of the augment enabls the user to engage in more powerful effects, establishing domination over minds.

**System**
- **Resistance Test:** Targets may attempt to resist mind manipulation by making a **Moderate** `Psychology x Mind` Test. You can spend **Potency** effect to increase the difficulty of their test.
- **Safety Checks:** Many of the listed effects result in [[persona#Safety Check|Safety Checks]] representing gradual [[persona#Corruption|Corruption]] and high level effects may directly add *Corruption*.

### Level 1
Basic Telepathy. You can read surface thoughts and project mental images and simple illusions, and form tight psionic communications network with allies. All effects come with the same set of complications to overcome.

**Effects**

- **Surface Scan (1):** Affects 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 **targets** in *Moderate* → *Long* → *Extreme* **Range**. You can hear what the targets are thinking and have the ability to project mental images to them.
- **Telepathic Link (1)**: Form a mental link with a 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 consenting **targets**, enabling two-way communication. An unwilling target makes a **Resistance Test**. Initial Link formation requires close proximity and physical contact, but afterwards, the Link can be maintained for a *Moderate* → *Long* duration without comprehensive limitations to distance.
- **Basic Illusion (1):** Create believable illusions affecting 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 **targets**, at *Moderate* → *Long* → *Extreme* **range** that are shattered upon close scrutiny. An illusion can be maintained for a *Short* → *Moderate* **duration**. Illusions may include visual and audible components, but cannot simulate physical sensations. GM may call for a `Design x Mind` test to determine how impactful your illusion is – if necessary.

**Common Complications**

- **Low Disruption (1):** Spend 1 point of PSI Integrity
- **Mental Strain (1):** Take 1 point of Stress.

### Level 2
Advanced Telepathy. You can reach deeper into the subject’s mindscape and project more believable illusions. All Level 2 effects comes with the same set of common complications, but some effects may include additional complications, mostly related to inflicting lasting damage on affected targets.

**Effects**

- **Scan (2):** Affects 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 **targets** in *Moderate* → *Long* → *Extreme* **range**. You forcibly intrude in their subconscious and gain access to their memories. Target takes 1 → 2 → 3 **Stress**.
	- **Brain Damage (1):** When you cease your control over the target, they remain in a catatonic permanently brain-damaged state with only small hope of recovery. Make a D8 **Safety Check** (Complication).
- **True Illusion (2):** You can create realistic illusions with full sensory perceptions affecting 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 targets in *Moderate* → *Long* → *Extreme* range. Illusions can cause physical sensations allowing you to manipulate the target. GM may call for further skill tests, to determines the effectiveness of your illusion, depending on the desired impact. Examples include:
	- **Horrifying Illusion:** Test `Design x Mind` and inflict 1 stress per 2 Effect Points. Make a D10 **Safety Check**
	- **Painful Illusion:** Test `Design x Habituation` and inflict 1 Shock per 2 Effect Points. Make a D10 **Safety Check**
	- **Impersonate:** Test `Manipulate x Mind` or `Persuasion x Mind` to impersonate someone else.
- **Suggestion (2)**: You can subtly manipulate the mind of 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 **targets**. As long as they fail the resistance test, you can keep feeding new suggestions, but each new set of instructions requires a separate test. Make a D8 Safety Check.
	- **Personality Disorder (1):** The target’s personality becomes distorted by your manipulation resulting in gradual, but noticeable change, mixing in echoes of you mind manipulation with reality and fragmented memories. In due time they will likely succumb to madness. Make a D6 **Safety Check** and Spend additional point of **PSI Integrity** (Complication).
- **Psionic Scream (1):** Unleash a terrifying, disturbing and violent psionic scream affecting anyone within a *Cone* → *Semi-Circle* → *Full Circle* **area** at *Moderate* → *Long* → *Extreme* **range** inflicting 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 Stress and Shock.
	- **Collateral Madness (1):** Some random bystanders in vicinity are affected and succumb to madness. The amount of people affected depends on how crowded the area is and the overall area of effect. They start acting violently and irrationally. The effect fades away in a few minutes, but by then the damage has likely already happened. Make a D8 **Safety Check** (Complication).

**Common Complications**

- **Moderate Disruption (1):** Spend 2 points of PSI Integrity
- **Moderate Mental Strain (1):** Take 2 points of Stress.

### Level 3
Dominate Minds and create increase the magnitude of any effects to majestic proportions. 

- **Resolute Overdrive:** You can spend additional Energy to re-roll a **PSI Test** once per energy spent. You can **Burn** energy to ignore any one complication.
- **Massive Decay:** When using any *Magnitude* effects resulting in large mass of affected people, any complications with related Safety Checks automatically result in a point of Corruption.

**Effects**
- **Magnitude—Targets (3):** You increase the magnitude of affected *targets* property to cover large crowds of people *room* → *crowd* → *building* → *city sector*.
- **Magnitude—Harm (3)**: The magnitude of Harm inflicted is increased: *Shock* is tracked as *Wounds* while *Stress* results in *a Mental Breakdown roll*.
- **Magnitude—Range/Radius(3):** A range property is enhanced to cover incredibly vast distances: *Kilometers* → *Continental* → *Inter-Continental* → *Inter-Planetary*.
- **Magnitude—Duration (3)**: Any effects with a temporary duration will become *permanent*.
- **Domination (3):** You can override any cognitive functions of 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 targets, within *Moderate* → *Long* → *Extreme* **range** forcing them to follow your commands without hesitation. Domination lasts for *Short* → *Moderate* → *Long* **duration**.

**Common Complications**

- **Severe Disruption (2):** Spend 3 points of PSI Integrity
- **Severe Mental Strain (2):** Take 3 points of Stress.

## Old Stuff
To use Psionics you need to spend 1 Energy per level of psinoic ability. In addition you must make a **Psionics test** using `Current Resolve + Psychology x Mind`. If you fail, you take a point of intrinsic stress.

**Psionics Boosting**: You can spend extra energy to Boost various properties of abilities, but you can also spend any bonus Effects from the Psionics test in similar manner.

You can use any abilities at your Psionics Level.

| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
