The HERMES Mobility Suite is an Advanced Mobility enhancement suite that augments the cyborg's movement capabilities, helping them move faster in combat and evade attacks easier.

**System**
	- **Activate** by spending 1 Energy as an Instant Action

### Level 1
- **Enhanced Mobility**: Cost for any **Sprint** Effects is reduced by 1. You can still only pick one Sprint Effect as default.
- **Enhanced Evasion**: Effect Point cost for **Evasive** is reduced to (1, 2, 4).

### Level 2
- **Super Jump**: You can jump incredible heights (up to 4 times normal) and distances. Reduce Difficulty of any actions for jumping by 3, when relevant, including landing safely.
- **Mode - Roller Blades**
	- Increase [[core-mechanics#Velocity|Velocity]] scale to **High**. You can easily match any ground vehicles in velocity and remain incredible mobile on even surface
	- Navigating rough terrain (stairs, grass, dirt) is more difficult and risky: add Complication **Unsuitable Terrain (2)** risking getting stuck or falling if you do not overcome it.
	- Once activated, this mode remains in effects without need to Maintain the effect. If you need the other benefits of **Mobility System** augment, you need to activate them separately.
	- Disable mode at will, but re-activation requires using another point of Energy.

### Level 3
- **Super Sprint**: You can take up to two(2) different **Sprint** effects to close in distances incredibly fast, in addition the the reduced Sprint effect costs from **Enhanced Mobility**.
- **Super Evasion:** Effect Point cost for **Evasion** is reduced to flat 1 per Effect and you can take up to 5 Evasive effects now.
- **Jump Jets:** You can activate short bursts of integrated jump jets to augment your mobility in creative ways. Each use of Jump Jets awards you one free re-roll in any Mobility Test. You get one free re-roll when augment has been activated, and you can use any number of Energy to gain another re-roll, whenever needed.
