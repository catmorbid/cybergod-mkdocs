Biomorphs can be used to mutate the frame in a rapid rate to grow extra layers of protection from muscle, bones, tendons. The process is generally called creating a Biomorph armor, but it will also alter the character' physical traits in such significant way that calling it just "armor" seems like an understatement. Mutation is always permanent unless recalled. Mutating the frame and then recalling it takes just a short duration. The sight itself is so gruesome most characters witnessing it will take **Stress**. Biomorph Armor can be reactivated to regenerated spent mitigation points.
