### Biomorph Healing

#Biotech #Unsafe 

You can use Biomorphs from close proximity to another target, or heal yourself to by spending an Action. Total **Healing Power** is `2x Energy Spent`, but each level requires a minimum energy to be spent to activate. You can spend additional energy to improve the effect, but the maximum wound level is limited by the ability.

Healing Power is a pool of points you can use to heal wounds. A wound requires Healing Power equal to their Damage Class equivalence.

>[!example]
>a Major Wound occurs at Damage Class 3, so you need 3 Healing Power to heal a Major Wound.

| Level | Effect              |
|:----- |:------------------- |
| 1     | Heal Minor Wounds.  |
| 2     | Heal Major Wounds.  |
| 3     | Heal Lethal Wounds. |
