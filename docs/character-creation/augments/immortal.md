### Immortal

#Cybertech #Nanotech #Passive 

Takes a backup of consciousness in realtime. Provided you have the means to deploy a new frame, you could be back in action within minutes of a Frame Death incident. 

>[!info]
>Immortal is always active and it **permanently** reduces available Energy by an amount equal to Augment Level. You can choose to disable it, but do you really want to?
