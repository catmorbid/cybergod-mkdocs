Specialized Tactical Marksmanship enhancement is an ideal augment for fire-team leaders and sniper spotters. **Pinpoint** automatically tracks marked targets and provides a real-time feed to allies on the targets and their positions. The system can also identify vulnerabilities, improving attack effectiveness against the targets.

**System**
- Spend 1 Energy to activate
- **Mark Targets**: Spend an Action to observe targets in the battlefield and mark them for yourself and allies. Make an Easy `Tactics x Cyber` test. Available effects depend on Augment Level. Mark Targets is susceptible to electronic interference.
- Resolve any Ranged or Melee attacks normally, but apply special benefits against Marks.

- **Mark (1)**: A single target is Marked while augment is in effect and line-of-sight (even by remote drones) can be maintained. The Cyborg and any allies gain +1D advantage on any attacks or actions to observe the target or maneuver against them.

### Level 2
Unlock new **Effects** for **Mark Targets** action.
