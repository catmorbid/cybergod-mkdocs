Specialized Tactical Marksmanship enhancement is an ideal augment for fire-team leaders and sniper spotters. **Pinpoint** automatically tracks marked targets and provides a real-time feed to allies on the targets and their positions. The system can also identify vulnerabilities, improving attack effectiveness against the targets.

**System**
- Spend 1 Energy to activate and use the **Mark Targets** action, or to maintain existing Marks.
- **Mark Targets**: Spend an Action to observe targets in the battlefield and mark them for yourself and allies. Make an Easy `Tactics x Cyber` test. Available **effects** depend on Augment Level. Mark Targets is susceptible to electronic interference. Marks can be maintained, for following rounds, but this requires additional energy expenditure. You can also choose to take the **Mark Targets** action again, but all existing Marks are reset.
- Resolve any Ranged or Melee attacks normally, but apply special benefits against Marks.

### Level 1
Unlock new **Effects** for **Mark Targets** action.

- **Mark (1)**: For each **Mark** effect bought, you can pick one target that is Marked while augment is in effect while Mark is maintained and target remains line-of-sight or detectable by any means, which can include remote drones, heat sensor, x-ray vision etc. The Cyborg and any allies gain +1D advantage on any attacks or actions to observe the target or maneuver against them.

### Level 2
Unlock new **Effects** for **Mark Targets** action.

- **Expose Vulnerability (1)**: For each effect bought, you can assign it to one **Marked Target** to expose a vulnerability. You or any allies receive +1 DC to their attacks against the target for one round. Can be stacked with *different* **Expose** effects.
- **Expose Weakness (1)**: For each effect bought, you can assign it to one **Marked Target** to expose a weakness. You or any allies receive +1 AP to their attacks against the target for one round. Expose Weakness can stack with a different **Expose** effect on the same Mark, but only once per Mark. Can be stacked with *different* **Expose** effects and repeated on different Marks.

### Level 3
Unlock new **Effects** for **Mark Targets** action.

- **Expose Critical Vulnerability (2):** For each effect bought, you can assign it to one **Marked Target**. The Cyborg (but not allies) gains +1 AP and +1 DC on next attack against the target. Effect stacks with any other **Expose** effects, but you can only assign one **Expose Critical Vulnerability** to a any single Mark.
