A stealth augment that can blend the character with their surroundings. Advanced tiers also help mitigate noise from movement and provide additional masking options. Unless an observers has a way to see through the camouflage, they cannot see the cyborg and have a -4D penalty to any actions against them, if even allowed. Camouflage is maintained even after the cyborg attacks a target, but taking any wounds will interfere with the camouflage.

A downside to camouflage is that you cannot use most **armor**, and only *Nano Weave* or integrated *Cybernetic Armor* work with Camouflage.

Likewise only **Small** melee weapons and Integrated weapon systems are viable when using Camouflage.
