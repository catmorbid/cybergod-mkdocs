Avatar enables physical remote presence at very distant locations through holographic interface. You can use holoprojection drones and and a location's built-in projection systems by accessing the location through remote connection. Once connected you can project Holographic Avatars to interact on your behalf. The area can be extended by connecting to new Access Points. If you lose access to the location, or all of your holoprojector drones are destroyed, your Avatars will immediately perish.

| 1     | Create a single Holographic Avatar within Moderate range for a Moderate duration for 1 Energy. Avatars are capable of normal physical interaction and they have Body D6 and Reflex D6. You can spend additional Energy to augment Avatar's Body or Reflex by one die step per Energy, up to D12. Avatars can pick up weapons and wear armor like any physical entity. |
| 2     | Long range. You can create multiple avatars, but each avatar costs separate energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3     | Extreme range. The total cost of each Avatar is halved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
