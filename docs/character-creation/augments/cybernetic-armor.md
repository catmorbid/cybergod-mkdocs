Integrated exoskeletal armor that cannot be removed without heavy tools. Cannot equip additional armor. Cybernetic Armor must be repaired once broken down. Parts of the armor, such as face and skull protection can be opened and closed at will for improved comfort, and may have artificial skin with touch sensitivity, but some parts are permanently bolted on to your frame and may never be removed. The details of each armor is up to the character. Higher levels of the augment also include additional servo-motors that assist in the increased weight of the armor

### Level 1
- **Medium Armor**: DR 2, Durable, Concealable.

### Level 2
- **Heavy Armor:** DR 3, Durable
- **Skeletal Reinforcement**: You can safely strike in melee with full force without damaging your Frame. Increase your **Max Attack Power** by +2 and gain +1D advantage on Toughness tests to endure physical strain and Soak damage.

- **Power Tackle:** Close Combat Maneuver performed at short distance (not engaged in close combat). Test `Fighting x Body` to slam your hardened exoskeleton frame at a target. DC 4, Forceful, Slow.
