Integrated exoskeletal armor that cannot be removed without heavy tools. Cannot equip additional armor. Cybernetic Armor must be repaired once broken down. Parts of the armor, such as face and skull protection can be opened and closed at will for improved comfort, and may have artificial skin with touch sensitivity, but some parts are permanently bolted on to your frame and may never be removed. The visual details of each armor is up to the character, and can vary from rough industrial designs to sleek, black spec-ops nightmare. Higher levels of the augment also include additional servo-motors that assist in the increased weight of the armor

**System**
	- **Passive effects**: Cybernetic Armor is entirely passive, you donâ€™t need energy to activate or use it
	- **Repairing Armor**: Armor must be repaired between combat. A set of tools and a test of `Moderate Troubleshooting x Mind or Cyber` will work, repairing one point of Durability Lost, plus another for every 2 Effect Points. This will take a Moderate amount of time. If you attempt self-repairs you must take +1 increase in difficulty.
		- **Armor Repair Patch**: You can use an advanced Armor Repair Patch (single-use item) to repair 1 DR worth armor damage in a bit shorter time, if you have access to those.
	- **Cyber Integration:** Cybernetic Armor is designed to integrate perfectly with any other augments, including **Camouflage** or **Weapon Systems**.
