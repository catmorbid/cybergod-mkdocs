title: Augments
---
Your initial Augments are determined by your **Frame**. Choose a frame from the ones listed in your chosen Faction.

> [!info]
> You can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve Augments. Augment Level costs 1 Upgrade Point.

**Activating** Augments is an **Instant Action** and costs 1 Energy per Level. You can choose to activate lower level abilities to conserve energy. Some Augments are tagged as #Passive  and those do not require energy expenditure.

Many augments can be **Boosted** by spending additional energy. When some property can be boosted, it's marked with an arrow symbol ->, indicating the new boosted property.

**Safety**: High level augments or those tagged as #Unsafe will trigger a *Decay Save* whenever they're used. The die size depends on the augment level and whether the augment has the unsafe tag. Only augments that require activation trigger *Decay Saves*.

| [2] Advanced  | D12  | D8     |
