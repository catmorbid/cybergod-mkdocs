title: Augments
---
Your initial Augments are determined by your **Frame**. Choose a frame from the ones listed in your chosen Faction.

!!! info Upgrading Augments
	You can spend **Upgrade Points** to improve Augments. Augment Level costs 1 Upgrade Point.

## Augmentation Technology
Augments are possible with three types of technology: `Cybertech`, `Nanotech` and `Biotech`. Each frame supports only one type of technology. So if your frame is a `Cybertech` frame,  you can only install augments with the `Cybertech` tag. Many augments support several technology.
## Activation
**Activating** Augments is an **Instant Action** and will add at least 1 point of Energy Usage. Some Augments are tagged as `Passive`  and those do not require energy expenditure.

## Boosting
Many augments can be **Boosted** by spending additional energy. When some property can be boosted, it's marked with an arrow symbol ->, indicating the new boosted property.

## Safety
High level augments or those tagged as `Unsafe` will trigger a *Decay Save* whenever they're used. The die size depends on the augment level and whether the augment has the unsafe tag. Only augments that require activation trigger *Decay Saves*.
