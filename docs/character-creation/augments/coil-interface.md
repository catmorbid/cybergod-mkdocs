### Coil interface

#Cybertech #Cyberweavers #Unsafe 
A system for remotely interfacing with any device that has any sort of circuitry, even without a software interface. Can also be used to inflict Feedback damage without hacking on cyborgs or synthetics and drain energy from electrical systems and cyborgs who lack the critical protection.
