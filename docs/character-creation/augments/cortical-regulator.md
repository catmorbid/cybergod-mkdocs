A specialized neural implant or bio-mod that suppresses emotional surges—both positive and negative—and enables the user to maintain a cold, calculating state of mind even under extreme stress. At higher levels, the implant can forcibly override deep-rooted inhibitions, accelerate cognitive processing, and impose partial mental “lockdowns.”

**System**
- **Activate**: Spend 1 Energy as an **Instant Action** (unless otherwise noted).
- **Maintain**: Spend 1 Energy per round in combat or 1 Energy per mental/social Skill Test in non-combat, as needed. When you stop maintaining, the effect ends immediately.
- **Cortical Strain (Unsafe)**: The GM may call for a `Toughness x Mind` test if overused or if you push it beyond normal parameters. Failure can lead to mental whiplash or emotional instability once the augment’s effect ends.
- **Cortical Crash**: When the effect ends, you may suffer a short “emotional overload” or “blankness.” (See level-based notes for details.)
- **Synergy: Adrenaline Rush:** Adrenaline Rush drives on high emotional rush and adrenaline, while Cortical Regulator derives its effectiveness from calm and emotional stunting. This does not however mean they are incompatible, but rather when combined, the augments make the character a cold-hearted emotionless killer fueled by muted, violent rage:
	- **Combined Stress Buffer:** Stress mitigation is the highest of either + half (round up) of the other augment. I.e. 5 when both augments are level 3.
	- **Extreme Crash:** You suffer both crash effects in full effect.
	- **Neural Decay:** Using both augments at the same time has high likelihood for causing neural decay; Roll an additional die for Safety Test when using both augments, equal to the lowest Decay die from either augment.

### Level 1
**Basic Emotional Override** – turn off intrusive emotions and maintain composure under duress.
- **Calm Mind:** Reduce Stress taken by 1 point. You can shake off minor emotional penalties (e.g. mild fear or intimidation). Difficulty for attempts to affect you with telepathy-based Psionics or other mental manipulation are increased by 1.
- **Minor Focus:** Once per scene you can a re-roll on any one **Mind-based** test.
- **Suppressed Empathy:** You take a -1D penalty from social detachment to any empathy-driven tests (such as **Networking** or heartfelt **Persuasion**). You come across as cold and emotionally distant.
- **Emotional Crash:** When you disable to augment, you feel emotionally detached and “flat” for a while e.g. until end of the Scene, or until a short rest, after which you will begin to “feel” again. GM may apply a minor penalty (-1D) on relevant social or creativity-based tests.

### Level 2
**Advanced Emotional Override** – further muting feelings and partial cognitive focusing.
- **Focused Mind:** Reduce Stress taken by 2 points. You can shake off moderate emotions, such as panic, despair or strong intimidation. Difficulty for attempts to affect you with telepathy-based Psionics or other mental manipulation are increased by 2.
- **Hyper Focus:** Once per round, you can re-roll any **Mind-based** skill test (negotiation, hacking, analytical tasks) or a **Cyber-based** test that is primarily mental, such as Hacking.
- **Emotional Lockdown:** As an Instant Action you can quell a Mental Breakdown in yourself or forcibly calm an *allied* target who consents and is linked to you via comms or neural connection. You, or the target, can ignore any Stress Checks or Mental Breakdown tests for 1 round – but they become emotionally numb, suffering a -2D penalty on any empathy-based test.
- **Moderate Crash:** A Cortical Crash will result in -1D penalty to any social, emotional or creative tests until the end of the Scene. You appear disturbingly unemotional and detached.

### Level 3
**Full Neural Governor** – The augment forcibly rewires emotional centers and can supercharge logical processes and make the user a sociopathic master manipulator.
- **Serene Mind:** Reduce any taken Stress by 3 points. You are almost immune to any kind of emotional effects. Difficulty for attempts to affect you with telepathy-based Psionics or other mental manipulation are increased by 3.
- **Neural Overdrive:** You gain a free re-roll in any Mind-based tests. In addition, by spending additional point of energy, you can gain an additional re-roll in any applicable tests.
- **Force Override:** As an Instant action and by spending 1 Energy you can attempt to forcibly shut down a target’s emotional drive. Make a `Hacking x Cyber` test for neural or remote link, or `Psychology x Mind` test when near them. On success, the target becomes “blank state”, completely emotionally suppressed and unresponsive to fear, empathy or compassion. It can break them from psionic or mind control influence, but may also cause unpredictable side-effects, subject to GM discretion. Equally useful for interrogating a subject or preventing someone from lashing out.
- **Heavy Crash:** Cortical Crash results in -2D penalty to empathy-based tests for the rest of the scene and -1D penalty for the following scene. Any suppressed meltdown checks are resolved instantly and may result in extreme emotional backlash or even a catatonic shut-down. Re-activating Cortical Regulator removes the penalties, but the following crash is even worse, resulting in -1D additional penalty.
