### The Crucible

#Cybertech #RadicalX

The poetically named Crucible is little more than a Suicide Bomb, a dangerously modified Reactor Core built to overload. It comes with a dead man's switch and the ability to trigger the device remotely by high-ranking operator. It is weapon whose delivery system is the unfortunate person picked for Crucible duty that day in the daily Radical X lottery where everyone loses.

A Black Box has 50% chance of surviving the Crucible detonation.
