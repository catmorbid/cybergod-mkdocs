You can interface with Smart Weapons and ordnance and use guided projectiles and access their combat data. **Smart Weapons** augment is ideal for high rate of fire weaponry enabling high number of Hits on single - and even multiple targets - compared to regular weapons.

Any Personal Weapons are automatically modified to be compatible, but random weapons picked from dead enemies are likely incompatible. Even if they were, Smart Weapons have high security and need to be hacked before they can be used.

!!! warning Compatibility
	Smart Weapons are only compatible with conventional firearms and slow projectile launches, such as missile launchers or grenade launchers and cannot be used with Gauss weapons, Laser weapons or Plasma weapons.

**System**
- **Activate**: Spend 1 Energy to Activate as an Instant Action
- **Smart Weapons Attack Test:** Test `Aim x Cyber` when using Smart Weapons to resolve Ranged Attacks
	- Available Effects are **Initiative(1)** and any Effects provided by your current Level of augment, including previous levels.
	- **Full Auto** attacks do not benefit from +1D recoil control bonus on attack if wielder’s Body exceeds the weapon’s Recoil.
### Level 1
- **Effects**
	- **Guided Volley (1):** Each **Guided Volley** counts as two regular Hits on center of mass inflicting regular damage. All Hits must be specified at a single target. Hit Limit +1.
- **Trigger Control**: Don’t waste ammo. Ammo usage is reduced by 1 but cannot be reduced below 1
- **Telemetry:** Projectiles provide detailed telemetry data up to 1km

### Level 2
- **Effects**
	- **Multi Target (1)**: Designates an additional target for **Guided Volleys**. Each target has separate Hit Limit, with -1 Penalty to Hit Limit per **Multi Target** effect. E.g. with one additional target a full auto burst has hit limit of 5, and five **Guided Volleys** are enough to produce 10 total Hits, inflicting 5 hits on both targets.
- **Bullet Cam**: Projectiles provide visual feedback in addition to regular telemetry for up to 3km. A single projectile can be guided manually after launching with a `Piloting x Cyber` Test at targets that are at Long Range or further, bypassing any range penalties.
- **Guaranteed Hit**: Alternate mode of attack. You don’t need to roll any dice, instead you score a single Hit at any one target that is within your weapon’s Effective Range.

### Level 3
- **Effects**
	- **Critical Guided Volley (3)**: Reduced projectile velocity to maintain finer control over point of impact. Generate 2 Hits with +2 DC each, aimed at a vulnerable location (such as head). No change to Hit Limit. Can benefit from **Multi-Target**.
	- **Disarming Guided Volley (2):** Guide projectiles to target’s weapon or a limb holding the weapon. Reduced projectile velocity means damage dealt is at -1 DC, but generates 2 Hits. Can benefit from **Multi-Target**.
- **Guaranteed Multi-Hit**: Alternate mode of attack. You don’t need to roll any dice, instead you score a single Hit at *any* *eligible* targets up to normal **Hit Limit** within the weapon’s Effective Range.
