title: Persona
---
You are a soldier, an enhanced human working for one of the major factions. They pay your bills, you follow their orders, that's the deal. Why did you join? What did you do before? What are your personal goals and how do they align with your Faction?

Your mind is backed up in the infinite reaches of Cyberweb, and you have lived many lives and experienced many deaths. This is not your first rodeo, nor will it be your last. Each life lived leaves an **Engram**, a strong memory imprinted in your cybernetic soul. A powerful trauma, and anchor to ground you to reality, or a vice you can't seem to shake. Rebirth is traumatic and some say a piece of your soul dies each time you're *reborn*.

## Origin

Origin is you backstory and history. Where did you come from and how did you end up where you are now. You can pick one of the following, or roll a die, or write up something unique. Feel free to adjust the description to suit your character.

Origin may provide you with information or circumstantial advantage based on your past experiences. Feel free to suggest to GM when this should apply.

Each origin grants you 3 skill points. You can assign the points to the suggested skills or consult the GM for alterations.

### Ancient Soldier

You were found in an ancient cryogenic storage hidden from prying eyes. You were a soldier in the war of the past, a relic of ancient times. You were given a chance for a new life, but your training and memories of different times were always rooted deep, and you always had a hard time finding your place in this new world.

**Skills:** Fighting, Aim, Tactics

### Child soldier
You were an outsider, captured at young age and forced to serve as a soldier in some warlord's band of merry bandits. The Warlord was eventually defeated and you were captured and offered a chance at redemption, becoming part of the Commonwealth.

**Skills:** Aim, Mobility, Alertness

### Ex-Convict
You have a troubled past, having been involved with criminals from young age, you knew not of another way to live your life. Eventually you were caught and thrown in the *Stasis*, part of your brain enslaved to serve the *Tri-Core*, all the while being re-educated in the virtual. You served your time and emerged re-educated, a promising candidate for the society. But civilian life did not suit you, and with all the conflict around you, you decided to take a stand, joining a faction you believed would serve your interests best.

**Skills:** Streetwise, any 2 non-combat skills.


### Free Port Survivor

You remember your home before the soldiers came in, before the Syndicate elites in black exoskeletons gunning down anyone who raised a hand, voice or an eyebrow. Before the anarchy and the fires. Before the gang wars and the extortion rackets that cost your family their life savings. You remember all the things your friends and family had to do just to survive - only to be gunned down in the street for forgetting to salute a drug kingpin's son. You remember hiding in a bomb shelter when the plasma fell. From a small window you watched as the sky was being lit in all the colors in the rainbow, raining indiscriminate death. Then one day the bombs died and you were still breathing. Emerging from the shelter you had chosen your side. Never again a victim.

**Skills:** Psychology, Alertness, Stealth

### Natural Born Cyborg

Your life started with a tragedy that took your life. Somehow they managed to keep you alive long enough to upload your consciousness. You grew without a body, living great part of your life in virtual reality. At some point you received your first *frame*, but the *realspace* always felt like an uncanny valley and you've had trouble fitting in ever since.

**Skills:** Design, Hacking, Troubleshooting

### Opportunist

You had a satisfying life and a successful career, but then you nearly died in a fatal accident. The surgeon knew what she was doing and managed to scavenge whatever was left of your brain and spine and give you a little life extension inside a stasis pod. You were technically alive, but there was very little of you actually left. When the offer came to give you a new life in a new body, in exchange for loyalty to a new employer, you took the opportunity. Such offers do not come often, what made you so special?

**Skills:** Any 3 skills

### Prodigy
You were a child prodigy, found at early age by the Commonwealth and brought into the society bypassing the usual bureaucratic hoops. You were met with unsurmountable expectations while overwhelmed with praise and promises, but were ill-prepared for the simple hardships of reality. They expected so much of you, but when you fell, you fell *hard*.

**Skills:** One skill gains +3.

### Slum kid
You grew up in the Ground Zone, among the literal shadows of civilization. They promised eventually you could become a citizen, but as years passed on and hope waned, you ended up with the wrong crowd and got to experience first hand the quality of life the GZ has to offer. Finally, one day it just happened. You got in, citizen of the Commonwealth. You may leave the GZ but the GZ never leaves you.

**Skills:** Alertness, Stealth, Streetwise

### Terrorist Victim

You were a victim of a terror attack that took the life of your loved ones and left you scarred and changed. Since the attack you have been obsessed with learning anything you can about the attack and the ones responsible with the hope of one day making an impact to prevent such tragedies and perhaps bring the ones responsible to justice.

**Skills:** Investigation, Networking, Psychology

### Traditionalist

You grew up in your chosen Faction. Your family was always involved, and so were you, indoctrinated from young age that his is the only path for you, and you should serve with pride and fulfill your duty. They never really gave you the opportunity to think for yourself, and now that you’re in deep already, you might not even have the option. Nevertheless, with your background they expect nothing but perfection.

**Skills:** Any training from faction.

### Volunteer

Your life was fine. You had a career, a family and friends. But deep down, seeds of dissatisfaction always churned inside. Then one day you simply had enough of being on the sidelines and decided to volunteer. This would mean leaving your stable life behind and risking your humanity for a cause your firmly believed in. Your family, friends and ex-coworkers think you're insane leaving a life of abundance like this, but for you, your life has just began.

**Skills:** Any 3 non-combat skills

### War Zone Refugee

You grew up in a small agricultural community that provided food for the Commonwealth. You enjoyed the simple life. Then one day some soldiers came by, told you war was coming. Then the drones and tanks rolled in, and next you knew it, the bombs fell. You were forced to escape together with your family and few others, but wherever you went it seemed the War Zone followed. You had to kill to survive, steal to eat and each day, while a step closer to the promised refuge, your group grew more and more desperate. United at first, the hardships took their toll and eventually they argued, and after blood was drawn, they parted and then you were only a few. You met other groups, some seemed friendly at first, but they weren't friends, they just wanted what was yours. A large convoy of refugees offered some protection, but wherever there's large number of people, there's corruption, violence and crime. Somehow you made it, but it felt like a lifetime ago since you left, and the person who finally arrived at the GZ wasn't the person who left their home all those months ago.

**Skills:** Alertness, Manipulation, Stealth

## Faction
Factions are listed on [[factions/index|Factions section]] of the core book. Read through the factions and choose the faction your character swears allegiance to. Faction is an important factor in the game, and as different factions have conflicting agendas and are outright in war, you should make your faction choices together with the group.

## Experience

You can choose how experienced your character is. More experienced characters have seen a lot and can be mental train wrecks, but they have more **Upgrade Points** to give them and edge and tend to have higher, but more focused **Skills**, while younger characters have more **Engrams**, **Resolve** and better **Aptitudes**, but will not excel at any one thing.

| Experience   | Engrams | Mental State | Resolve | Skills | Upgrades |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------ | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| Relic        | 1       | +4           | 1       | +12    | 8        |
| Veteran      | 2       | +3           | 2       | +9     | 6        |
| Professional | 3       | +2           | 3       | +6     | 4        |
| Experienced  | 4       | +1           | 4       | +3     | 2        |
| Recruit      | 5       | Normal       | 5       | +0     | 0        |
Note down the benefits from your chosen experience level, then proceed with character creation.
### Recruit
You are a fresh recruit with only basic training and rudimentary skills, starting at the lowest rung of the ladder. But what you lack in *merits* or experience, you compensate with exceptional talent.

	!!! info
	Playing a recruit can be challenging as you have much less Upgrades to work with and your Mental State may make you a weak link in the team

### Experienced
You have some notches on your belt, you’ve seen some action and you know the toll this job has your very soul. Nevertheless you have a great deal of ambition and confidence to drive you forward to greatness.

### Professional
You are a steady professional who has been on the job for quite a while. You know your strengths and your weaknesses well and despite having experienced your share of trauma, you are relatively stable.

	!!! info
	**Professionals are the expected baseline**

### Veteran
You’ve been on the job for a long time. Long enough to know how the system works, how things tend to fold out. Nothing really surprises you any more. Your life is in shambles, you’ve lost so much and gained very little. But regardless, there’s still something that keeps you on the going, that makes you tick. But your time is running out, retirement looms in the horizon. If they ever let you.

### Relic
You’ve seen things most people wouldn’t believe. Unimaginable horrors, violence, depravity and enough trauma to shatter you into a million fragments. You are but a shell desperately trying to hold on to a broken spirit, ready to die. Sometimes you think they keep you around for their amusement. Or perhaps they’re just *afraid of you*. You are on the edge, waiting for one more slip to take you away. Whatever hope you find anywhere, better hang on to it, like your soul depends on it – because it does.

	!!! info
	Relics are extremely rare and may not last for long. Their upgrades make them deadly and powerful, but at the same time, they can be volatile and limited in their expertise. It is a challenge of its own, and not recommended as first time experience.

## Engrams

Engrams are strong memories deeply embedded in the character's digital psyche. Distant memories of past lives, vivid traumas and deep-rooted habits that make the character who they are, and define their humanity. Death and Rebirth are traumatizing and can result in the corruption of the Digital Psyche, represented by loss of Engrams. 

Write down 1-5 engrams, filling one of the five available slots. The number of engrams determines the character's experience where lower number means more experience. Since each death takes away a little bit, it is presumed that the longer you've been in the game, the more you've died and traumatized. You have a past, and it's not a nice one.

Each Engram adds a point of **Resolve** and some **Skill Points**, but will cost you **Upgrade Points**. The total number of Engrams also determines a modifier to your [[#Mental State|Mental State factors]], leading you further away from humanity.


**Engram Slots**

- **Aspiration**: A personal goal, something to strive towards. What drove you to this?
- **Anchor**: Something that grounds you to reality. Family, friends, loved ones, or things covered with emotion and remembrance.
- **Belief**: A strong belief, such as a philosophy or a spiritual world view. This is your moral compass, how you believe you should act in the world.
- **Fear**: Most people are afraid of something. Fear can be a weakness, but also a source of strength; something to overcome.
- **Vice**: A bad habit, an *urge*. A source of satisfaction.

### Corruption

Corruption represents permanent damage to the character's consciousness. Bad code, glitches in the OS, accumulation of errors due to constant reconstruction of the Mind after many deaths, or simply experiencing horrifying events that scar the psyche. While the system is designed to work with Cybernetic Brains and digital personalities, corruption does not require a cybernetic brain, and can be implemented even if the character has a fully natural frame. It can be used to represent various ailments of the mind, such as PTSD or alzheimer's disease. One way of gaining corruption is through severe Stress or gradual decay.

Corruption can be gained in a few ways, for example:

- Dying and being Reborn
- Being exposed to extreme stress or horrors
- Over-use of powerful combat drugs or other mind-altering substances
- Powerful and malevolent cyber weapons

Whenever you take a point of **Corruption**,  you must proceed to make a **Corruption Save** rolling a D6 for each point of Corruption you have. If you fail, then one of your **Engrams** is permanently corrupted. You must remove one **Engram** and you also lose the associated Resolve point and a single **Aptitude** point. You can then erase all accumulated Corruption points. This will also increase one of your **Mental State** factors by one.


!!! warning The End
	If your last Engram is corrupted, you will cease to be a functional human. This is as close to real death as you can get here. Your character might continue to exist as an artificial intelligence inside a husk, a mere shell, or they may end up in a psychosis, culminating in a sudden violent killing spree. Or they can wander off into the unknown, never to be heard of again. You can decide what happens to your character after, but you can't play with them any longer. Write the final paragraph of their story. But that will be the end.

### Removing Corruption

Corruption can only be removed by undergoing extensive therapy. This will cost time, likely some Resources, and finally, as a token of the character's dedication to this process, some experience points. If all conditions are met, one point of corruption can be removed.

  - Spend [[progression|Progression Points]] to remove a point of Corruption.
  - Requires at least 4 therapy sessions (downtime activity).

### Decay Saves

Decay measures corruption on a much smaller scale, often as consequence of over-using drugs or powerful augments. Decay is not tracked, but rather whenever you take Decay, you must make a **Decay Save**.

*Decay Saves* use the die indicated by a **Safety** rating. If you fail the save, you will immediately take a point of corruption

## Aptitudes

Aptitudes determine talent and basic ability at related skills. Each Aptitude is linked to 3 skills.

| Aptitude Rating | Talent   | Degree of talent                                                                     |

## Skills

Skills determine the character’s expertise and learned experiences. Each skill is linked to a default [[#Aptitudes|Aptitude]], and when making a [[core-mechanics#Tests|Skill Test]] you usually roll dice from both the skill and the linked *Aptitude*. If you do not have a skill, you can still make a related test using just the Aptitude level.

!!! info Character Creation
	**Character Creation**

## Resolve

[[#Engrams]] determine the character's humanity, or how much is left of it. It also affects their **Resolve**, which is a pool of resources that can be spent to get out of sticky situations and invoke internal reserves of strength at times of desperation. It's a combination of persistence, luck and force of will.

Resolve can be used in the following ways to improve the outcome of [[core-mechanics#Simple Test|Tests]] or [[core-mechanics#Saves|Saves]]:

- **Spend** Resolve to gain a [[core-mechanics#Rerolls|Reroll]] *after* rolling the dice on *any* test or save.
- **Burn** Resolve *before* rolling the dice to automatically succeed at a Test or a Save. A Test succeeds with the bare minimum outcome, usually just a Basic effect. If a Test is impossible, you cannot succeed no matter how much Resolve you're willing to burn.

If the listed usage is not enough, Game Masters are encouraged to invent additional uses for Resolve and players can always *suggest* spending or burning resolve to survive a tricky situation.

### Refreshing Resolve

**Spent** Resolve is **Refreshed** by one point at the start of each game session. Resolve is usually fully refreshed after some [[core-mechanics#Structure of play|Downtime]], once the character has had some time to relax.

A **burned** resolve is much more difficult to Refresh. This is generally up to the GM how often they allow refreshing burned resolve. E.g. long downtime or going on a vacation or achieving a significant story goal may refresh burned resolve, to give a few examples. If the character has burned all their resolve, the may be forced on a leave of absence until they recover some.

### Improving the character

You will be awarded [[progression|Progression]] and [[merits|Merits]] as you play the game and complete missions. Once you accumulate enough, you can spend them to improve your character. You can mark them on your character sheet. For more information on Progression and Merits see [[gamemastering/index|Game Mastering]] section.

## Mental State

Mental state represents gradual shift in the character's psyche and loss of their humanity. It is represented by two **factors**: **Dissociation** and **Habituation**. Characters start with D6 in both factors, and gain 1 level for every Engram they have lost due to Corruption. Mental State factors are primarily used to resist Mental Breakdown due to stress, but can be used like any other attribute, if appropriate.


### Dissociation
Dissociation describes the character's connection to reality, emotions and their self. As the character undergoes stressful and traumatic experiences, such as *Rebirth*, they may dissociate themselves from reality. Dissociation helps with self-control when faced with danger and excitement and social pressure, but may make social interaction more difficult.

!!! info Dissociation and social tests
	When engaging in social dialogue, your base difficulty is set by your level of Dissociation. So for typical humans social tests are *Easy*, while a relic who is *detached* from reality may find it *very hard*.

**Gameplay Use**

Make a Dissociation Save when subjected to **extrinsic** Stress, such as entering a firefight, or when put under social pressure. Roll one die per total accumulated Stress. If any saves fail, you must roll on the **Mental Breakdown** table.

| Level | Rating                 | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D6    | Integrated             | Fully aware and connected to reality, emotions and self                                                           |
| D8    | Mild dissociation      | Occasional feelings of detachment from emotions and surroundings                                                  |
| D10   | Moderatre dissociation | Frequent disconnection from emotions, feeling detached from oneself or the environment                            |
| D12   | Detached               | Complete emotional numbness, profound detachment from reality, leading to lack of empathy and concern for others. |

### Habituation

Habituation describes the character's reactions to new strong stimuli, such as violence, suffering, or extremely stressful situations. They become desensitized to immoral acts and may find it easier to perform such actions themselves and in the extreme end they can become volatile and violent, prone to violent psychotic episodes when put under stress.

!!! info Habituation and mental breakdowns
	Habituation makes your mental breakdowns worse and determines the die you roll on the Mental Breakdown table.

**Gameplay Use**

Make a Habituation Save when subjected to **intrinsic** Stress, such as performing extreme acts of violence, torture or abuse.

| Level | Rating               | Description                                                                                   |
| ----- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D6    | Sensitive            | You react strongly to new stimuli including violence and distress.                            |
| D8    | Mild Habituation     | Gradual reduction in sensitivity to repeated stimuli, less reactive to familiar stressors     |
| D10   | Moderate Habituation | Significantly reduced emotional response to stimuli that once caused distress.                |
| D12   | Complete Habituation | Indifferent to repeated exposure to violence or suffering, almost immune to emotional impact. |
