# Cybergod: Reborn
**Augmented Science Fiction Roleplaying Game**

**Cybergod: Reborn** is a high sci-fi roleplaying game of action, intrigue, espionage with possible horror elements, set in a future timeline of Earth, ravaged by nuclear cataclysm, then rebuilt into a marvelous technological utopia guided by a Trinity of sentient AI’s. You are augmented soldiers, operatives, agents, zealots or mercenaries working for one of the Factions. Your consciousness is backed up in the Cyberweb, and your Frame is but a temporary shell, but *death*, it always *feels* real.
