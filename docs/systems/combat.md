title: Combat System
---

Regardless of which faction you vouch for, there are times when diplomacy fails and you must fight in armed conflict to defeat your adversaries through force. Do remember, that combat is **extremely deadly**, and even the toughest armor will be sheared away by a hail of bullets. Success in combat requires *tactics* and careful planning. While death is not the end, it can result in **failure**; failed objectives, missed opportunities and loss of precious resources.

!!! info Using Lethal Force
	Different factions may have limitations on when using lethal force is warranted. Commonwealth factions **ARC** and **Section 12** are most limited, while the Syndicate and Radical X probably have most freedom on the issue. For the Commonwealth use of Lethal Force comes down to ethical and moral considerations, and **ARC** especially is limited in this aspect, and must always seek permission before using lethal force. Thankfully the process is quick and amounts to simply contacting the local Regulator AI working under Themis, with the request, which will then process it using all available data.
	
	For the **Order of the Void** and the **Syndicate**, it's mostly down to optics, as in how would the act of violence look in the public eye. Same goes for the **Radical X**, who while known for acts of immense violence, may not always wish to be seen as mindless violent brutes.
	
	Mercenaries such as **Cyberweavers** handle it according to clients' preference on the matter.

## Turn order

Combat is resolved in phases, and during each phase characters and opposition act in a freeform order. Combat is intended for theater-of-the-mind gameplay, so a detailed tactical grid map is not necessary, although rough outlines to visualize the scene are always useful.

### Tactics Phase

Tactics Phase is resolved at the start of the combat, or when situation calls for it, usually before any shots are fired. Each group involved in combat designates a leader, who then tests their `Tactics x Mind`. Difficulty may be influenced by a number of factors, such as the environment, lighting conditions, weather, population density etc. Whatever you can think can shift the difficulty in either direction.

Once the test is resolved, the leader can then decide how to distribute the gained effects. The rest of the team is free to voice their opinions, but the leader should be the one to make the decision.

**Effects**

- **Ambush(2)**: Organize an ambush. Enemies do not get an action during the first round.
- **Bonus Action (2)**: One player character receives a Bonus Action for the first round
- **Bonus Reaction (2)**: One player character receives a Bonus Reaction for the first round
- **Soft Cover (1)**: One character starts out with 4 soft mitigation until they switch position.
- **Hard Cover (2)**: One character starts out with 2 hard mitigation until they switch position.
- **Spread Out (1)**: Team starts with optimally spread positions, so enemies cannot target them as a single group
- **Herd them(2)**: Enemies start out in a relatively tight group making them prime targets for suppression and area effect weapons.
- **Flanking maneuver(2)**: One character flanks the enemy, bypassing their cover.

### Combat Phase

Once tactics phase is resolved, you start the combat. The first turn can be influenced by the Tactics phase, so make it count.

Each character gets to take one **Action** and one **Reaction**. Action is declared at the start of the round, but Reaction can be decided when the time is right.

Activating Augments is an **Instant Action**, unless otherwise stated, and can be repeated for as often as required, unless the augment is already activated.

Each character should describe their actions vaguely. For example:

- *"I stick to cover and shoot the biggest guy"*
- *"I close in stealthily to attack their hacker"*
- *"I want to use combat hacks on their heavy gunner"*
- *"I'll fix the generator while you guys keep them off my back"*
- *"I'll wait to see what happens, but ready to shoot if anyone approaches"*

After the actions are declared, you can start by resolving them one at a time. Enemies may want to intercept, so those actions are **Conflicting** and are then resolved simultaneously, and whoever has better Initiative gets to resolve their action first. If initiative is matched, then actions are resolved at the same time. It is possible for both participant to be wounded or even killed if initiative is matched.

**Reaction** can be chosen at any time before or after resolving your Action, and usually in reaction to another character's action, enemy or friendly. Reactions are often defensive, but there isn't really any limit.

#### Initiative

Initiative is only considered for Conflicting actions to decide who acts faster. Default initiative is based on [[frame#Reflex|Reflex]]. In addition you can always take Initiative as Effect when resolving your action to act faster than the opposition.

#### Splitting actions
Actions can be split between different simultaneous actions. For example, you can move and shoot or move and dive for cover, or shoot with a weapon in your both hands. You can't split between multiple same actions.

When you split an action, you take a **Disadvantage** equal to **total number of Actions** split between to each action. So two actions is -2D and three actions is -3D. It's recommended to not allow splitting between more than three actions. If you don't have enough dice, you can't do the split.

## Close Combat

Test `Close Combat x Body or Reflex` for both attack and defense. Whoever gets more successes wins and inflicts damage. When fighting unarmed **Damage Class** is 1, otherwise you use the DC from melee weapon.

**Effects**

- **Hit(1)**: Target takes damage at DC 1 or weapon DC. You can assign hits to different targets or accumulate them to one target. **Default Limit: 2 Hits**
- **Initiative(1)**: Be faster than the other guy. If you have more initiative, your action is resolved first.
- **Attack Power (1)**: Damage Class +1 for all hits. **Effect Limit** depends on Body: D6=1, D8=2, D10=3, D12=4
- **Weak Spot Hit(2)**: Hit target at a weak spot. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+1**.
- **Critical Hit(4)**: Hit target at a critical location. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+2**.
- **Disarm (2)**: Disarms the target. You can grab their weapon or toss it away.

## Ranged Combat

Various weapons handle differently, so to make ranged attacks test `Ranged Combat` skill with the appropriate **attribute** depending on [[gear#Weapons|Weapon Type]]. Also take into consideration any penalties due to weapon [[gear#Range|Range]] and [[core-mechanics#Distance|Distance]] between you and the target.

**Effects**

- **Hit(1)**: Target is hit and takes damage at DC equal to Weapon DC. You can assign hits to different targets, or accumulate multiple hits on the same target. **Default Limit: 2 hits**.
- **Weak Spot Hit(2)**: Hit target at a weak spot. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+1**.
- **Critical Hit(4)**: Hit target at a critical location. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+2**.
- **Initiative(1)**: Be faster than the other guy. If you have more initiative, your action is resolved first.
- **Disarming Hit (3)**: Aim at target's weapon or e.g. limb that holds the weapon. You inflict regular damage, but also disarm the target. Weapons that are hit can be repaired with enough time.

### Suppressive Fire

Fully automatic weapons can be used to lay suppressive fire. You don't need an attack test, but instead you indicate a Fire Zone, which is a cone shaped area that will then cause everyone in the area to take a Hit if they take any actions while within the Fire Zone. This will likely lead the targets to take cover instead, to avoid getting hit.

You must be stationary and take no other actions to lay suppressive fire.

Non-automatic weapons can also lay suppressive fire, if coordinated carefully so that at least 3 Fast weapons or 5 normal speed weapons are used for the effort. Such an attempt certainly takes skilled leader and requires a **Tactics x Mind** test to pull off.

## Dual weapons

Wielding and using two weapons simultaneously is a matter of [[#Splitting actions]] between each hand. If you have Reflex of D8 or lower, you get an additional -1D on the off-hand attack. With Reflex D10 or higher you are ambidextrous and do not suffer additional penalties.

## Mobility and Evasion

Armor and cover are good ways to mitigate damage, but a better way is to not get hit in the first place. This can be achieved by being mobile throughout combat, and that means keeping on the move. You can take a Move action and test `Mobility x Reflex` to close in some [[core-mechanics#Distance|Distance]] and you can always choose Evasive effects to make yourself a hard target.

**Effects**

- **Sprint(1)**: Close in a moderate distance or reduce Long distance by one step.
- **Fast Sprint(2)** Close in a long distance or reduce Extreme distance by one step.
- **Evasive(1, 3, 6)**: Enemies take -1D penalty to attack you during this round. Can repeat up to -3D, but each new level of Evasive is more difficult to achieve.

## Taking Cover

You can spend an action to take cover. You must test `Tactics x Mind` against a difficulty depending on how hard it is to find cover. On success, spend effects to determine the quality of cover. Any mitigation awarded by cover are temporary and only last until the cover is destroyed, you are flanked or you leave the cover.

**Effects**

- **Minimal Cover(0)**: 1 point of mitigation
- **Basic Cover(1)**: 2 points of mitigation
- **Good Cover(2)**: 4 points mitigation
- **Full Cover(3)**: 6 points of mitigation. You are completely concealed from attackers, they can approximate your position but precise attacks are hard to pull off. Attacks against you are at 3D disadvantage if you donâ€™t take any actions that would present yourself as a target.

## Damage
When a character is hit in combat they can receive [[#Conditions]] that reflect various degrees of physical trauma and wounds to their Frame. Conditions are determined by the [[#Damage Class]] of an attack, which can be reduced by [[#Mitigation and Penetration|Mitigation]] or [[#Damage Reduction]].

When you receive a condition, there is always a possibility for a bad situation becoming even worse; most non-fatal conditions have some sort of [[#Triggers|Trigger]] that can cascade into worse conditions â€“ and eventually death.

!!! warning
	Combat can be extremely lethal as the damage system makes it possible for even small wounds to escalate into fatal wounds. To improve chances of survival, you can put skill points to Toughness, upgrade your Body attribute, wear good armor or augments that provide mitigation. As a final resort, you can use Resolve to give you a fighting chance when the odds are not in your favor.

### Damage Class

**Damage Class (DC)** of an attack is determined by the Weapon used. For unarmed attacks DC is 1 (non-lethal) and most firearms have a DC between 2 and 5, but there isnâ€™t an upper limit.

DC determines the inflicted [[#Conditions|Wound Condition]], not accounting for [[#Mitigation|Mitigation]]. An attack can generate multiple Hits, and each Hit is handled separately.

### Mitigation

Damage can be **Mitigated** by spending **Mitigation Points**, which represent some type of protection such as personal armor or cover provided by surroundings. All mitigation points are single use only, and when provided by armor or equipment, loss of mitigation points represents wear and tear of said equipment. Some mitigation points may be temporary, provided by certain conditions, such as being under [[#Taking Cover|Cover]].

Spend Mitigation Points to reduce damage of incoming hits. A **Mitigated Hit** will reduce DC to **half** (rounded down) of normal *unmitigated* hit.

The cost of mitigating a hit is equal to the **Armor Piercing (AP)** stat of the attack. Minimum AP rating is 1/2 indicating that you can spend 1 point to mitigate 2 hits.

| Armor Piercing | Description | Examples                                            |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1/2            | Low         | Shotguns, hollow-point rounds, low-power lasers.    |
| 1              | Standard    | Common Military-grade firearms and lasers.          |
| 2              | High        | Light armor piercing rounds, high-power lasers      |
| 3              | Superior    | High-velocity armor piercing rounds, plasma rounds  |
| 4              | Ultra       | Hypersonic projectiles                              |
| 5+             | Extreme     | Large caliber hypersonic armor-piercing projectiles |

Mitigation Points are exhausted until they can be replenished. If provided by armor, the armor takes permanent damage for each point spent and must be replaced or repaired before the points are replenished. Mitigation Points from cover and other non-permanent sources of protection, such as energy barriers should be used first and tracked separately.

!!! example
	Boris takes a blast from an automatic shotgun and takes 6 hits of DC 3 and AP 1/2. Boris spends 3 mitigation points to mitigate all hits, reducing each hit to DC 1.

!!! example 2
	Kitah has been ambushed by a sniper and is trying to move from cover to cover to avoid a hit. Kitah found some cover worth 2 points but takes a well-aimed shot dealing DC 7 AP 2 Hit. The cover is barely enough and Kitah spends both mitigation points to reduce the hit to DC 3.

### Damage Reduction
Damage Reduction (DR) reduces the Damage Class directly, *before* applying any mitigation. High DR can make a character entirely immune to lower tier DC. DR is very scarce and is only provided by heaviest armor or massive targets, representing a major difference in scale.

!!! example
	Boris is fighting against a heavily armored R-LER Mk 3 drone and fires off a burst from his CHAOS Mk.2 sidearm, landing 4 hits with DC 3 and AP 1. The Drone is very tough and has DR 2 plus 10 points of mitigation. After applying DR, Boris inflicts 4x DC 1 hits. The Drone then spends 4 Mitigation to reduce all hits to DC 0, taking no damage at all and still has 6 mitigation to spare.

### Applying Damage
When a character takes damage in combat, they receive physical [[#Conditions|Conditions]] based on the [[#Mitigation|mitigated]] [[#Damage Class]] of each hit. If you take multiple Hits, you also take multiple conditions. [[#Conditions]] are tracked separately and as you receive them, you must resolve their [[#Triggers]]. You only need to resolve each type of Trigger once, after marking down all conditions resulting from an attack.

Resolve all triggers starting from *lowest* severity first, since those may increase the worst conditions.

| Damage Class | Condition      | Wound Penalty | Trigger                 | Stabilize?                 |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1            | [[#Bruised]]   |               | [[#Shock Trigger]]      | No                         |
| 2            | [[#Wounded]]   | -1D           | [[#Escalation Trigger]] | No                         |
| 3            | [[#Injured]]   | -2D           | [[#Critical Trigger]]   | No                         |
| 4            | [[#Dying]]     | -4D           | [[#Death Trigger]]      | Yes â†’ [[#Maimed]]          |
| 5            | [[#Dead]]      |               | nothing                 | Yes â†’ [[#Dying]] (1 round) |
| 6+           | [[#Destroyed]] |               | nothing                 | No                         |

!!! example
	Boris received 6 hits at DC 1 each inflicting 5 levels of [[#Bruised]] condition â€“ the final level is ignored as Boris is already maxed on Bruised condition â€“ and has to resolve [[#Shock Trigger]].

!!! example cascading conditions
	Kitah takes DC 3 damage from the sniperâ€™s attack and is now [[#Injured]], marking down one level of injured condition, and now must resolve [[#Critical Trigger]]. Kitah has Body D6 and Toughness 3 for a dicepool of 3D6. Kitah rolls 2, 3, 3 â€“ thatâ€™s a failure. Kitah receives *Dying* condition, and now has to resolve [[#Death Trigger]]. Kitah Rolls 3D6 again: 4, 3, 1 â€“ another failure, this time resulting in death. Luckily the player still has one point of resolve left so they re-roll all dice: 6, 6, 3 â€“ a success! Kitah collapses and is dying â€“ but manages to hang on for a while.

!!! example multiple conditions
	Zin Long is fighting a bunch of thugs in a crowded bar and lands 2 hits with his Ultra-Blade to one of the thugs inflicting DC 4 AP 2 per hit. The Thug can only mitigate one hit, so the other goes through unmitigated causing **Wounded** and **Dying** conditions. The Thug resolves [[#Escalation Trigger]] rolling 4D6: 1, 4, 3, 2 â†’ thatâ€™s a failure. Thug receives an **Injured** condition and now has to resolve [[#Critical Trigger]] rolling 2, 4, 4, 1 â€“ another failure, this time adding second level of **Dying** condition. The Thug now finally resolves the [[#Death Trigger]] from **Dying** condition at threshold 2 and rolls 1, 1, 4, 5 â†’ only 1 success is not enough to beat the threshold of 2 and the Thug succumbs to their wounds and dies.

### Condition Test
A Condition Test is required when the character needs to *resist* a certain physical or mental condition. Condition Tests are called  Condition Test is always a `Toughness x Body` test.

**Success Threshold** of a Condition Test is usually equal to the Level of Condition. Condition Tests do not suffer from usual circumstantial penalties such as *Wound Penalties*, but they cannot be **assisted** either. Certain external aids such as painkillers or stims may award Bonus Dice to Condition tests.

### Conditions

Condition is inflicted according to the **mitigated Damage Class** of a hit. Conditions stack and are tracked separately. Each condition has an immediate effect, and most conditions also have a [[#Triggers|Trigger]] requiring a [[#Condition Test]] to avoid additional consequences.

Some conditions need **stabilization** to prevent character death, requiring a **MedTech** test.

Conditions have 1-5 levels, and whenever you receive a condition, you increase its level by one. Condition Level affects the success threshold of linked [[#Triggers]]. Once condition level is maxed, you do not need to add new conditions, but still need resolve any [[#Triggers]] associated with the condition.
#### Bleeding
*Bleeding* condition does not have any immediate effects, but it inflicts additional damage at the start of each round. Make a [[#Condition Test]] against condition Level. Bleeding inflicts damage *ignoring DR and Mitigation* at DC equal to condition level, but each **success** reduces damage taken by one. First Aid or meds can be used to reduce the level of *Bleeding*.

#### Bruised
`Wound Condition`

*Bruised* condition indicates minor damage such as bruises or small cuts. When inflicted, you need to resolve [[#Shock Trigger]].

#### Burning
The character is engulfed in flames and will take continuous *damage* and *stress* at the start of each round until the fire is extinguished. Make a *Condition Test* against condition level at start of each round. *Burning* inflicts damage at DC equal to condition level, but each **success** reduces damage taken by one. If you take any damage from *burning*, you also take a point of **Stress**. Burning can be extinguished with appropriate measures, usually requiring an action and opportunity.

#### Dead
The character has taken lethal wounds and will be [[#Destroyed]] very soon.  You cannot take any actions are effectively [[#Incapacitated]].

There is however a relatively small timeframe when the body can be *stabilized* with a `Hard MedTech x Mind` test, turning death into a [[#Dying]] condition instead. Failing the test or taking too long means the character dies. You only have one chance to survive this and you also need to act fast. It is GMâ€™s call how long you have.

#### Dying
`Wound Condition`

You take a -4D [[#Wound Penalty]] on all actions due to crippling pain. Painkillers can only mitigate half of the penalty. When inflicted, and *at the start of every round* thereafter, you must resolve [[#Death Trigger]].

The condition can be **stabilized** with first aid, meds or treatment. Without meds you need a `Moderate MedTech x Mind` test. Once stabilized you are no longer **Dying** and instead receive the **Maimed** condition.

#### Fatigued
Fatigued can be inflicted as consequence of over-strenuous physical activity, sleep deprivation or excessively burning through energy reserves. E.g. GM could assign fatigued as a complication on a very demanding physical test.

You are unable to function at peak performance due to over-exertion and are closer to collapsing. You take a -1D penalty per condition level to any skill tests.

#### Incapacitated
Your are unable to take any actions or reactions. Most humans would lose consciousness but you may sometimes retain consciousness, but are unable to act in any way regardless. Incapacitation lasts for a **Moderate** duration.

#### Injured
`Wound Condition`

Take a -2D [[#Wound Penalty]] on all actions due to serious pain and physical trauma. When inflicted, resolve [[#Critical Trigger]].

#### Maimed
`Wound Condition`

A [[#Dying]] condition that is treated becomes a *Maimed* condition. You take -3D [[#Wound Penalties]] but do not need to resolve [[#Death Trigger]] any longer.

#### Destroyed
This condition is final. You are dead and thereâ€™s no way to resuscitate or recover. Overkill is often extremely brutal and gory and will inflict Stress on any allies.

#### Stunned
You are unable to take any actions, and your next **Reaction** is at -2D penalty, stacking with wound penalties. Stunned is recovered automatically after you have taken your next Reaction. If you take multiple levels of *stunned*, you erase one mark after each Reaction taken, but remain afflicted until the condition is completely removed.

#### Wounded
`Wound Condition`

Take a -1D [[#Wound Penalty]] on all actions due to painful wounds. When inflicted, resolve [[#Escalation Trigger]]


### Triggers
When you receive a new condition, or increase the level of an existing condition, a *Trigger* is usually activated, possibly leading to further consequences. Triggers require a [[#Condition Test]] to pass, failure results in a cascade of consequences.

!!! info
	Resolve can be spent on Condition Tests, and doing so may be a very good idea in order to avoid death or crippling conditions.

#### Death Trigger
You must make a [[#Condition Test]] against a threshold of condition level. On failure, the character receives the [[#Dead]] condition.

#### Shock Trigger
Make a [[#Condition Test]]. The threshold to ignore all shock is equal to [[#Shock Level]], but you can obtain a partial success at half the threshold but still receive [[#Stunned]] condition. On **failure** you receive [[#Incapacitated]] condition.

**Success Thresholds:**

- **Success([[#Shock Level]])**: You are unaffected by the shock.
- **Stunned([[#Shock Level]] / 2 (round down))**: You receive [[#Stunned]] condition.
- **Failure**: You receive [[#Incapacitated]].

!!! example
	Boris is pretty badly beat-up and has received Bruised-6 and Wounded-2, and now must resolve a Shock Trigger. His total [[#Shock Level]] is 8 so the thresholds are 4 and 8. He rolls 5D10: 7, 7, 5, 4, 3. Thatâ€™s only 3 successes, resulting in failure and Boris is now [[#Incapacitated]] due to shock. This might be a good spot to spend some Resolve to reroll the two failed dice as Boris only needs 1 more success to become [[#Stunned]] instead.

#### Escalation Trigger
Make a [[#Condition Test]] at threshold equal to [[#Wounded]] condition level. On failure, your wounds escalate to more severe injuries and you receive an [[#Injured]] condition, triggering any linked consequences as well.

#### Critical Trigger
Make a [[#Condition Test]] at threshold equal to [[#Injured]] condition level. On failure, your condition becomes critical and you receive [[#Dying]] condition, triggering any linked consequences as well.

### Shock Level
Shock Level is equal to the total of all **Wound Conditions**, which are:
- Bruised
- Wounded
- Injured
- Maimed
- Dying

!!! example
	Zin Long is in a bad shape after fighting a bar full of thugs. He has Bruised-5, Wounded-3, Injured-1. His total Shock Level is 9. He is barely standing, but remains victorious.

### Wound Penalty
Only highest level of Wound penalty is applied. E.g. if you have both [[#Wounded]] and [[#Injured]] condition, you apply the -2D penalty from [[#Injured]] only. Wound penalties are applied to all **Skill Tests** but they do not apply on **Condition Tests**.

### Non-Lethal damage
When taking Non-lethal damage, you replace any normal [[#Triggers]] with [[#Shock Trigger]] instead. Even non-lethal damage can cause death when Damage Class is high enough, but they wonâ€™t escalate to more severe conditions. When inflicting multiple Hits, you only resolve [[#Shock Trigger]] once, after marking everything down.

!!! example
	Kitah finds themselves facing an enemy in close quarters, forcing them into hand-to-hand combat. Kitah strikes the enemy with their modified Fast Shock Stick landing 3 hits with non-lethal DC 4, AP 1. The soldier has 2 mitigation which is enough to drop 2 hits to DC 2, but the third one goes through at DC 4. The enemy is now [[#Wounded]]-2 and [[#Dying]]. The enemy must resolve [[#Shock Trigger]] and rolls 3D6: 5, 1, 3 for 1 success. Their Shock Level is now 3, so with 1 success they achieve a partial success and are now [[#Stunned]] and have -4D wound penalty. The enemy is effectively taken out.

### Recovery and survival
If you do not die from your wounds, then youâ€™ll survive. There are a few ways to recover from wounds:

- **Emergency Treatment**: In field conditions, you can test `MedTech x Mind` to administer first aid or even field surgery. provided you have the tools. Critical wounds require **stabilization** before they can be treated.
- **Nano Stims**: Fast-acting advanced high-grade medical nano-bots can be injected to accelerate healing. Excessive use is not recommended. Nano Stims can be administered and programmed for various purposes, but you need to decide how you wish to apply it:
	- Fully heal [[#Bruised]] condition in Short Duration
	- Fully heal [[#Bleeding]] condition in Short Duration
	- Heal 1 level of Wounded condition in Moderate Duration
	- Heal 1 level of Injured condition in Long Duration
- **Augments**: Certain augments enable rapid regeneration at high energy cost.
- **Natural Recovery:** Wounds heal at different rates naturally. Proper medical care will significantly reduce this time.
	- **Bruised**: One condition level is removed at end of scene.
	- **Wounded**: One condition level is healed per day
	- **Injured**: One condition level is healed in 10 days
	- **Maimed**: One condition level is healed in 30 days

While recovering from wounds completely almost always takes a long time, it may be easier to obtain some pharmaceutical aid to help alleviate the pains. Only the highest bonus of any drugs apply at any one time.

- **Painkillers**: Safe and effective aid for alleviating pain. Reduce Wound Penalties by 1D for Moderate duration and gain +1D bonus on Wound Condition Tests. Safety D12. Common Grade. Safety D12.
- **Combat Stimulants**: A powerful smart drug that increases adrenaline and dopamine by moderate amounts and blocks pain receptors. Reduce Wound Penalties by 2D and gain +2D bonus on all Condition Tests for a Moderate duration. Become [[#Fatigued]] for moderate duration after use. Advanced Grade. Safety D8.
- **Adrenaline Boosters**: Low-grade street drugs that boosts adrenaline and dopamine levels through the roof, making the user feel invincible. Reduce [[#Wound Penalty]] by 3D and gain +2D bonus on all Condition Tests for Moderate duration, but after the effect cools down, gain [[#Fatigued]] condition for a Long duration â€“ that is unless you take another hit. Safety D6. Highly addictive.

### Simplified Damage Rules
`Optional rule`

GM may opt to simplify damage rules to speed up gameplay. This may be especially useful when resolving combat against a large number of minor NPCâ€™s. Significant characters should always use the full rules to emphasize their level of threat and even the playing field with player characters.

**Condition Tests** are resolved automatically based on Condition Level and the characterâ€™s Body Attribute. Toughness skill is ignored for this purpose.

| Body | Failure Threshold |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| D6   | Condition Level 1 |
| D8   | Condition Level 2 |
| D10  | Condition Level 3 |
| D12  | Condition Level 4 |

**Shock Triggers** are resolved by comparing [[#Shock Level]] to a pre-calculated **Shock Threshold**.

**Shock Threshold**: Body Level + Toughness + Physical aptitude.

If Shock Level meets or exceeds the Shock Threshold, the Shock Trigger Condition Test results in [[#Incapacitated]] condition.

If Shock Level is equal or more than half Shock Threshold (rounded up), then the character becomes [[#Stunned]] instead.

!!! example
	A Syndicate Ronin has Body D8 (level 2) and Toughness+Physical 5. Their Shock Threshold is 7. They have taken 1 injury and 2 bruises and receive 2 hits bringing them to Bruised-3 and Injured-2. They first resolve Shock Trigger with Shock Level 5 resulting in Stunned condition, since Shock Level 5 is equal or more than Stun Threshold 4. Next they resolve the Critical Trigger from injured, which also fails inflicted Dying condition.

## Death and Rebirth

Death is not the end in Cybergod. If your frame dies, your character is out of commission for the remainder of the game session. Your team mates must recover your **Black Box**, a Quantum Digital Storage device implanted somewhere into your frame. Team Mates should be able to know what they're looking for and recovery itself is pretty straightforward, although it might get a bit messy.

Once the *Black Box* has been recovered, it can be used to upload your consciousness to the **Soul Server**, a cyberweb-based consciousness backup storage with a direct and secure connection. Once uploaded, the consciousness will be updated and can now be downloaded into a new Frame. You need some downtime, but as a rule of thumb, a new frame should be ready the next game session, provided the players had the time to recover and upload the Black Box. This might mean you must sit back for the remainder of the mission. If a black box cannot be recovered, you can be reverted to a state of your previous backup. Backups are usually done regularly, at least before sending you off to a mission.

If your black box was successfully recovered, you can keep any earned experience and even gain experience on the session your frame died. If however you must resort to a previous backup, your character will lose any earned experience and memories after the backup.

On every Rebirth the character takes a point of Corruption and then must immediately make a **Corruption Test**.

!!! info Waiting for resurrection
	It can take some time before your character is reborn and can enter the play again. You should however not just wait around and skip the game while waiting. Instead you can pick up an NPC and play them, or roll another, secondary character to play in between. Maybe the team calls for backup and you enter as one of them, a side character perhaps, but nevertheless part of the game.

## Stress

Witnessing violence, fear and otherworldly horrors puts a strain on the mind. Only the most hardened veterans become almost immune, and many claim that's the only way to know know if you're still human, machine or not.

Stress is handled different than physical damage, and instead of knives and bullets causing the harm, stress is caused by tense situations, such as social pressure, violence, mind-altering drugs, psionic resonance and witnessing otherworldly horrors.

Stress is generally measured on a scale of 1 to 5, but it does not have an upper limit.

### Stress Check

Whenever you take Stress, mark it down on the stress tracker and make a [[core-mechanics#Resource Checks|Resource Check]] with [[persona#Dissociation|Dissociation]], rolling dice equal to current stress. If you fail, you suffer from [[#Mental Breakdown]].

| Stress | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1      | Minor       |
| 2      | Moderate    |
| 3      | Major       |
| 4      | Severe      |
| 5      | Extreme     |

!!! info Tracking Stress
	Only major characters and player characters should roll stress dice and track stress. Minor characters should simply roll on the mental breakdown table if they take any points of stress, or GM should decide the outcome.

### Mental Breakdown

Having failed a Stress test you need to roll your [[persona#Habituation|Habituation]] Die to resolve outcome on mental breakdown. You can spend a points of [[persona#Resolve]] to re-roll the outcome once.

### Reducing Stress

To recover stress naturally the characters must spend some [[core-mechanics#Structure of play|downtime]] to rest and relax, allowing them to recover at least one point of stress. Stress recovery can be increased in the following ways:

- Spend the downtime in activity relating to their [[persona#Engrams|Engrams]], to recover additional point per engram engaged with this way
- Spend some time in therapy
- Use drugs or other substances that alleviate stress
- Partake in other relaxing activities
