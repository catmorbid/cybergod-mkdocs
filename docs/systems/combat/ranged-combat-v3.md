Various weapons handle differently, so to make ranged attacks test `Aim` skill with the appropriate **attribute** depending on [[gear#Weapons|Weapon Type]]. Also take into consideration any penalties due to weapon [[gear#Range|Range]] and [[core-mechanics#Distance|Distance]] between you and the target.

**Effects**

- **Hit(1)**: Target is hit and takes damage at DC equal to Weapon DC. You can assign hits to different targets, or accumulate multiple hits on the same target. **Default Limit: 2 hits**.
- **Weak Spot Hit(2)**: Hit target at a weak spot, adding +1 AP.
- **Critical Hit(4)**: Hit target at a critical location. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+4**.
- **Initiative(1)**: Be faster than the other guy. If you have more initiative, your action is resolved first.
- **Disarming Hit (3)**: Aim at target's weapon or e.g. limb that holds the weapon. You inflict regular damage, but also disarm the target. Weapons that are hit can be repaired with enough time.

### Suppressive Fire

Fully automatic weapons can be used to lay suppressive fire. You don't need an attack test, but instead you indicate a Fire Zone, which is a cone shaped area that will then cause everyone in the area to take a Hit if they take any actions while within the Fire Zone. This will likely lead the targets to take cover instead, to avoid getting hit.

You must be stationary and take no other actions to lay suppressive fire.

Non-automatic weapons can also lay suppressive fire, if coordinated carefully so that at least 3 Fast weapons or 5 normal speed weapons are used for the effort. Such an attempt certainly takes skilled leader and requires a **Tactics x Mind** test to pull off.
