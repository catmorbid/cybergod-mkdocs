Various weapons handle differently, so to make ranged attacks test `Aim` skill with the appropriate **attribute** depending on [[gear#Weapons|Weapon Type]]. Also take into consideration any penalties due to weapon [[gear#Range|Range]] and [[core-mechanics#Distance|Distance]] between you and the target.

**Effects**

- **Hits:** You can stack several Hits to one target or distribute Hits between multiple targets. **Default Hit Limit is 2**, accounting for total number of Hit effects you can distribute between targets. Each type of Hit has separate EP cost.
	- **Normal Hit(1)**: Target is hit and takes *normal damge* based on weapon used.
	- **Weak Spot Hit(2)**: Hit target at a weak spot, inflicting *normal damage* with +1 *Armor Piercing*.
	- **Critical Hit(4)**: Hit target at a critical location. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+4**. If a critical wound is inflicted, apply suitable **Condition** such as *Crippled* or *Stunned* based on hit location.
- **Initiative(1)**: Be faster than the other guy. When actions *conflict* the action with higher total initiative is resolved first.
- **Disarming Hit (3)**: Aim at target's weapon or e.g. limb that holds the weapon. You inflict regular damage, but also disarm the target. Weapons that are hit are likely damaged and cannot be utilized, but can be repaired given enough time.

### Suppressive Fire

Fully automatic weapons can be used to lay suppressive fire. You don't need an attack test, but instead you indicate a Fire Zone, which is a cone shaped area that will then cause everyone in the area to take a Hit if they take any actions while within the Fire Zone. This will likely lead the targets to take cover instead, to avoid getting hit.

You must be stationary and take no other actions to lay suppressive fire.

Non-automatic weapons can also lay suppressive fire, if coordinated carefully so that at least 3 Fast weapons or 5 normal speed weapons are used for the effort. Such an attempt certainly takes skilled leader and requires a **Tactics x Mind** test to pull off.
