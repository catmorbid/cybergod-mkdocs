## Close Combat

Make an [[core-mechanics#Opposed Test|Opposed Test]] of `Fighting x Body or Reflex` for both *attack* and *defense*. If the target is not defending themselves (they do not take an action to fight back), the test is resolved as a normal **Easy** test.

**Unarmed Combat:** When fighting unarmed **Damage Class** is 1, otherwise you use the DC from melee weapon.

**Effects**

- **Hits:** You can stack several Hits to one target or distribute Hits between multiple targets. **Default Hit Limit is 2**, accounting for total number of Hit effects you can distribute between targets. Each type of Hit has separate EP cost.
	- **Normal Hit(1)**: Target takes damage at DC 1 or weapon DC. You can assign hits to different targets or accumulate them to one target.
	- **Weak Spot Hit(2)**: Hit target at a weak spot, bypassing armor. Inflict damage like a regular hit, but increase AP by 1.
	- **Critical Hit(4)**: Hit target at a critical location. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+4**.
- **Initiative(1)**: Be faster than the other guy. If you have more initiative, your action is resolved first.
- **Attack Power (1)**: Damage Class +1 for all hits. **Effect Limit** depends on Body: D6=1, D8=2, D10=3, D12=4
- **Disarm (2)**: Disarms the target. You can grab their weapon or toss it away.
- **Immobilize (2):** Prevents the target from moving, e.g. by engaging a grapple hold. The target is not permanently held however and they may attempt to fight back by spending further actions.
- **Pin (4):** Pin the target in place without chance for escape. The attacker cannot take any Physical actions while maintaining a Pin hold, but they do not need to make further tests either.
	- **Forced Escape:** Target may take an action and attempt a **Very Hard** `Mobility x Body` test to escape from a Pin hold, taking 2 wounds through armor even when successful.
		- **Complication: Severe Damage (2):** Deal additional 4 wounds through armor unless bought off.
