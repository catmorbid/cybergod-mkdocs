## Close Combat

Test `Close Combat x Body or Reflex` for both attack and defense. Whoever gets more successes wins and inflicts damage. When fighting unarmed **Damage Class** is 1, otherwise you use the DC from melee weapon.

**Effects**

- **Hit(1)**: Target takes damage at DC 1 or weapon DC. You can assign hits to different targets or accumulate them to one target. **Default Limit: 2 Hits**
- **Weak Spot Hit(2)**: Hit target at a weak spot, bypassing armor. Inflict damage like a regular hit, but increase AP by 2. **Hit Limit Applies.**
- **Critical Hit(3)**: Hit target at a critical location. Inflict damage at  **Weapon DC+4**. **Hit Limit Applies.**
- **Initiative(1)**: Be faster than the other guy. If you have more initiative, your action is resolved first.
- **Attack Power (1)**: Damage Class +1 for all hits. **Effect Limit** depends on Body: D6=1, D8=2, D10=3, D12=4
- **Disarm (2)**: Disarms the target. You can grab their weapon or toss it away.
