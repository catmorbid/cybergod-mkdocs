title: Taking Cover
---

You can spend an action to take cover. You must test `Tactics x Mind` against a difficulty depending on how hard it is to find cover. On success, spend effects to determine the quality of cover. Any mitigation awarded by cover are temporary and only last until the cover is destroyed, you are flanked or you leave the cover.

**Effects**

- **Minimal Cover(0)**: 1 point of mitigation
- **Basic Cover(1)**: 2 points of mitigation
- **Good Cover(2)**: 4 points mitigation
- **Full Cover(3)**: 6 points of mitigation. You are completely concealed from attackers, they can approximate your position but precise attacks are hard to pull off. Attacks against you are at 3D disadvantage if you donâ€™t take any actions that would present yourself as a target.
