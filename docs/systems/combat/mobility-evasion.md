Armor and cover are good ways to mitigate damage, but a better way is to not get hit in the first place. This can be achieved by being mobile throughout combat, and that means keeping on the move. You can take a Move action and test `Mobility x Reflex` to close in some [[core-mechanics#Distance|Distance]], or simply makes yourself a hard target - or combine both.

Player can choose alternate goals as well, for example, climbing or jumping higher to reach a better vertical vantage point, or rolling through obstacles. These kind of objectives are subject to GM call and will affect the difficulty of the test.

**Interpreting failure**
If you fail mobility test, it doesnâ€™t mean your character is suddenly unable to move, but rather that there were obstacles on the way you could not cross, or did not see before. Maybe an unexpected oily surface caused you to slip and loose your footing for a moment, reducing the momentum.

**Effects**

- **Sprint:** You can only pick one Sprint effect to close in a distance
	- **Quick Sprint(1):** Close in a Short distance.
	- **Sprint(2)**: Close in a moderate distance or reduce Long distance to Moderate.
	- **Fast Sprint(4)** Close in a long distance or reduce Extreme distance by one step.
- **Evasive(1, 3, 6)**: Enemies take -1D penalty to attack you during this round only. Effect can stack up to -3D, but each new stack of Evasive costs more: the cost noted is the total cost for the effect at particular Level
