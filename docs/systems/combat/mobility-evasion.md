title: Mobility and Evasion
---

Armor and cover are good ways to mitigate damage, but a better way is to not get hit in the first place. This can be achieved by being mobile throughout combat, and that means keeping on the move. You can take a Move action and test `Mobility x Reflex` to close in some [[core-mechanics#Distance|Distance]] and you can always choose Evasive effects to make yourself a hard target.

**Effects**

- **Sprint(1)**: Close in a moderate distance or reduce Long distance by one step.
- **Fast Sprint(2)** Close in a long distance or reduce Extreme distance by one step.
- **Evasive(1, 3, 6)**: Enemies take -1D penalty to attack you during this round. Can repeat up to -3D, but each new level of Evasive is more difficult to achieve.
