title: Death and Rebirth
---

Death is not the end in Cybergod. If your frame dies, your character is out of commission for the remainder of the game session. Your team mates must recover your **Black Box**, a Quantum Digital Storage device implanted somewhere into your frame. Team Mates should be able to know what they're looking for and recovery itself is pretty straightforward, although it might get a bit messy.

Once the *Black Box* has been recovered, it can be used to upload your consciousness to the **Soul Server**, a cyberweb-based consciousness backup storage with a direct and secure connection. Once uploaded, the consciousness will be updated and can now be downloaded into a new Frame. You need some downtime, but as a rule of thumb, a new frame should be ready the next game session, provided the players had the time to recover and upload the Black Box. This might mean you must sit back for the remainder of the mission. If a black box cannot be recovered, you can be reverted to a state of your previous backup. Backups are usually done regularly, at least before sending you off to a mission.

If your black box was successfully recovered, you can keep any earned experience and even gain experience on the session your frame died. If however you must resort to a previous backup, your character will lose any earned experience and memories after the backup.

On every Rebirth the character takes a point of Corruption and then must immediately make a **Corruption Test**.

!!! info Waiting for resurrection
	It can take some time before your character is reborn and can enter the play again. You should however not just wait around and skip the game while waiting. Instead you can pick up an NPC and play them, or roll another, secondary character to play in between. Maybe the team calls for backup and you enter as one of them, a side character perhaps, but nevertheless part of the game.
