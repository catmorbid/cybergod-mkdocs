title: Stealth Combat
version: 1

Stealth approach in combat requires careful planning, but it can be extremely effective when properly applied.

To take a Stealth Action in combat, make the appropriate Stealth Test against a static difficulty or as a Contested Action against the observerâ€™s `Alertness x Mind`. Once detected, any attempts to hide again from observers will be substantially more difficult (subject to GM call).

**Effects**
- **Undetected (1)**: Remain undetected. Prerequisite for any follow-up effects.
- **Assassinate(1-5):** Immediately assassinate a target. Only available for weak enemies and minor characters. Players and Major characters cannot be assassinated. Cost of effect varies according to circumstance, available weapons and toughness of character. GM Call. If the target has comms link with other characters in scene, they will likely know that something is going on, so disabling or interfering with their comms systems may be critical. You can assassinate multiple targets if possible by spending the required EP for each target.
- **Advantage (1-3)**: Award an 1D advantage to a follow-up action. Stacks up to 3D.
- **Opportunity (2):** Create an opportunity or diversion that benefits another character in some way. Actual effects depend on circumstances.
