title: Turn order
---
Combat is resolved in phases, and during each phase characters and opposition act in a freeform order. Combat is intended for theater-of-the-mind gameplay, so a detailed tactical grid map is not necessary, although rough outlines to visualize the scene are always useful.

### Tactics Phase

Tactics Phase is resolved at the start of the combat, or when situation calls for it, usually before any shots are fired. Each group involved in combat designates a leader, who then tests their `Tactics x Mind`. Difficulty may be influenced by a number of factors, such as the environment, lighting conditions, weather, population density etc. Whatever you can think can shift the difficulty in either direction.

Once the test is resolved, the leader can then decide how to distribute the gained effects. The rest of the team is free to voice their opinions, but the leader should be the one to make the decision.

**Effects**

- **Ambush(2)**: Organize an ambush. Enemies do not get an action during the first round.
- **Bonus Action (2)**: One player character receives a Bonus Action for the first round
- **Bonus Reaction (2)**: One player character receives a Bonus Reaction for the first round
- **Soft Cover (1)**: One character starts out with 4 soft mitigation until they switch position.
- **Hard Cover (2)**: One character starts out with 2 hard mitigation until they switch position.
- **Spread Out (1)**: Team starts with optimally spread positions, so enemies cannot target them as a single group
- **Herd them(2)**: Enemies start out in a relatively tight group making them prime targets for suppression and area effect weapons.
- **Flanking maneuver(2)**: One character flanks the enemy, bypassing their cover.

### Upkeep Phase

- Resolve any persistent conditions (e.g. bleeding or burning)
- Remove 1 Shock from every combatant
- Check if any Augments have effects that ended
### Combat Phase

Once tactics phase is resolved, you start the combat. The first turn can be influenced by the Tactics phase, so make it count.

Each character gets to take one **Action** and one **Reaction**. Action is declared at the start of the round, but Reaction can be decided when the time is right.

Activating Augments is an **Instant Action**, unless otherwise stated, and can be repeated for as often as required, unless the augment is already activated.

Each character should describe their actions vaguely. For example:

- *"I stick to cover and shoot the biggest guy"*
- *"I close in stealthily to attack their hacker"*
- *"I want to use combat hacks on their heavy gunner"*
- *"I'll fix the generator while you guys keep them off my back"*
- *"I'll wait to see what happens, but ready to shoot if anyone approaches"*

After the actions are declared, you can start by resolving them one at a time. Enemies may want to intercept, so those actions are **Conflicting** and are then resolved simultaneously, and whoever has better Initiative gets to resolve their action first. If initiative is matched, then actions are resolved at the same time. It is possible for both participant to be wounded or even killed if initiative is matched.

**Reaction** can be chosen at any time before or after resolving your Action, and usually in reaction to another character's action, enemy or friendly. Reactions are often defensive, but there isn't really any limit.

#### Initiative

Initiative is only considered for Conflicting actions to decide who acts faster. Default initiative is based on [[frame#Reflex|Reflex]]. In addition you can always take Initiative as Effect when resolving your action to act faster than the opposition.

#### Splitting actions
Actions can be split between different simultaneous actions. For example, you can move and shoot or move and dive for cover, or shoot with a weapon in your both hands. You can't split between multiple same actions.

When you split an action, you take a **Disadvantage** equal to **total number of Actions** split between to each action. So two actions is -2D and three actions is -3D. It's recommended to not allow splitting between more than three actions. If you don't have enough dice, you can't do the split.
