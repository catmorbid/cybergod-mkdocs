title: Stress
---
Witnessing violence, fear and otherworldly horrors puts a strain on the mind. Only the most hardened veterans become almost immune, and many claim that's the only way to know know if you're still human, machine or not.

Stress is handled different than physical damage, and instead of knives and bullets causing the harm, stress is caused by tense situations, such as social pressure, violence, mind-altering drugs, psionic resonance and witnessing otherworldly horrors.

Stress is generally measured on a scale of 1 to 5, but it does not have an upper limit.

### Stress Check

Whenever you take Stress, mark it down on the stress tracker and make a [[core-mechanics#Resource Checks|Resource Check]] with [[persona#Dissociation|Dissociation]], rolling dice equal to current stress. If you fail, you suffer from [[#Mental Breakdown]].

| Stress | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1      | Minor       |
| 2      | Moderate    |
| 3      | Major       |
| 4      | Severe      |
| 5      | Extreme     |

!!! info Tracking Stress
	Only major characters and player characters should roll stress dice and track stress. Minor characters should simply roll on the mental breakdown table if they take any points of stress, or GM should decide the outcome.

### Mental Breakdown

Having failed a Stress test you need to roll your [[persona#Habituation|Habituation]] Die to resolve outcome on mental breakdown. You can spend a points of [[persona#Resolve]] to re-roll the outcome once.

### Reducing Stress

To recover stress naturally the characters must spend some [[core-mechanics#Structure of play|downtime]] to rest and relax, allowing them to recover at least one point of stress. Stress recovery can be increased in the following ways:

- Spend the downtime in activity relating to their [[persona#Engrams|Engrams]], to recover additional point per engram engaged with this way
- Spend some time in therapy
- Use drugs or other substances that alleviate stress
- Partake in other relaxing activities
