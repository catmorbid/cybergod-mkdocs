You can spend an action to take cover. You must test `Tactics x Mind` against a difficulty depending on how hard it is to find cover. On success, spend effects to determine the quality of cover. GM may present available cover as a list, using the Effect costs to determine costs for cover.
- Cover awards DR and MP like any armor.
- Cover may include armor tags (Durable, Fragile)
- Cover MP is refreshed like those from Armor at start of each round.
- Cover must always spend MP - even if minimum damage is dealt, but hits dealing minimum damage do not bypass cover: Target behind cover is unharmed in this case.
- Cover is destroyed when its DR are all spent.
- Cover may be flanked by tactics and maneuvering, meaning it cannot be applied
