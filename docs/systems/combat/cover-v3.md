You can spend an action to take cover. You must test `Tactics x Mind` against a difficulty depending on how hard it is to find cover. On success, spend effects to determine the quality of cover. GM may present available cover as a list, using the Effect costs to determine costs for cover.
- Cover award Cover Points and possibly temporary DR
- Each Hit at a target in Cover expends one Cover Point, but also counts as a free Mitigation Point for the target
- Cover Points represent coverâ€™s Durability and when they run out, the Cover is destroyed.
- Cover Points do not refresh, like Mitigation Points
- Cover is destroyed when its DR are all spent.
- Cover may be flanked by tactics and maneuvering, ignoring the Cover.

**Cover Types**
- Light Cover: 5 Cover Points
- Hard Cover: 1 DR, 5 Cover Points
- Heavy Cover: 2 DR, 10 Cover Points
