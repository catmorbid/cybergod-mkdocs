A plethora of religious, pseudo-religious and spiritual belief systems co-exist in the world, but a majority of them are marginal and the only major religion is **The Order of the Void**, which was created during the post-collapse era. Commonwealth is absolutely secular and while it allows the practice of any kind of belief system, it does not allow any exemption to the laws and rules of society to any kind of organization, religious or otherwise. Certain practices of goodwill and charity are seen as beneficial to society and are awarded with RP merits, taking into consideration the value of the efforts.

Many of the old-world major religions were slow to adapt to post-collapse conditions, but have nevertheless maintained some degree of presence. Places of worship have become virtual forums and large communities exist in the Cyberweb.
  
# The Order of the Void

The **Order of the Void** is a globally recognized spiritual movement—and, to some, a dangerous cult—that has grown into a formidable power in recent decades. Members venerate an entity they call **“The Sensible,”** which they claim to be an extra-terrestrial or otherworldly intelligence capable of granting “blessings” that permanently alter its followers’ bodies. Within the Order’s ranks, these **Blessed** beings wield monstrous organic weaponry and uncanny resilience, fueling the Order’s reputation as both harbingers of religious salvation and architects of terror.

## 1. Origins & Recent Growth

### From Post-Collapse Religions to a Unified Cult

**Early Post-Collapse Religiosity (1–80 AC).**  
After the global Collapse, countless religious groups—some old (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism) and many new—vied for influence in a world shattered by nuclear war, famine, and social upheaval. Some faiths tried to adapt to the new utopian ideals ushered in by the rise of the Tri-Core (Gaia, Themis, Hyperion). However, many older denominations failed to reconcile their doctrines with an SI-guided society and eventually dwindled.

**Predecessor Sects: Church of Free Thought & Followers of the Core of Existence (80–2280).**  
Two notable upstart faiths rose to prominence:

- The **Church of Free Thought**, a radical group encouraging its followers to resist any oppressive force—be it AI rule or corporate tyranny—through direct action.
- The **Followers of the Core of Existence**, a pacifist sect built around a drug-fueled manifesto called _The Core of Existence_ (penned in 2069 by Emmet Mailer), preaching cosmic unity under a mysterious entity known as **The Sensible** (sometimes pluralized as “the Sensibles”).

These two sects appeared ideologically opposed—one was militant, the other deeply pacifistic—but they shared many philosophical roots in _The Core of Existence_ and eventually found common ground in their skepticism toward the Tri-Core.

**Birth of the Order (2280).**  
Leaders of both sects announced a formal union, creating the **Order of the Void**. Fragmentary versions of the old sects survived as minor splinters, but the new Order rapidly eclipsed them. By the dawn of the 24th century, the Order commanded millions of adherents worldwide. Despite suspicion from the Commonwealth, it operated openly, building temples, feeding the poor, and conducting mesmerizing ceremonies.

**Modern Popularity**  
Today, the Order claims a billion followers—roughly 10% of Earth’s population—and offers “solace and communion” to the destitute. Its charismatic leaders publicly condemn the “tyranny of the Tri-Core,” calling upon humanity to reject cybernetic augmentations and rely on “the pure gifts of the flesh.” Common citizens, especially those living in Ground Zones or impoverished Free Ports, flock to the Order for spiritual support. Critics point out that beneath the benevolent image lurks a fanatical war machine.


## 2. Core Beliefs & the Sensible

### The “Core of Existence” & Mailer’s Revelations

The Order’s doctrinal centerpiece is a text called **_The Core of Existence_**, first drafted by Emmet Mailer in 2069. Mailer, an otherwise unremarkable individual (rumored to be a chronic underachiever and drug user), claimed to write the entire 217-page original in a single night under the direct influence of “The Sensible.” The text became a pre-collapse era oddity that however had gathered a surprisingly large following, which ensured the text’s survival past the Collapse, and later emergence of Followers of the Core of Existence as a religious group.

1. **Historic Recantation**  
    The book’s **first** section reinterprets human history through the Sensible’s eyes—tying ancient mythologies, modern conflicts, and post-Collapse anxieties to the idea that mankind is watched (and at times, guided) by otherworldly beings.
    
2. **Philosophical Debate**  
    The **second** section presents a meandering philosophical dialogue between Mailer and the Sensible, covering ethics, technology, the future of humanity, and the concept of “impurity.” This part is notoriously cryptic, fueling countless revised editions that incorporate new commentaries or reinterpretations.
    
3. **The Prophecy**  
    The **third** section prophesies a final apocalypse in which human civilization destroys itself—save for a chosen remnant who will be saved by the Sensible. Modern Order teachings suggest that this “end times” may already be unfolding, hinting at the Bloody New Year being the catalyst event.
    

### Core Concepts: Purity & The Void

The Order’s day-to-day teachings revolve around **Purity**—the rejection of “impure” influences such as advanced technology, chemical stimulants, or heretical ideas. They believe in a state called **The Void**, achieved when a person strips away all external corruption and becomes a vessel for the Sensible’s will. Reaching the Void is said to grant unimaginable peace and spiritual power but often involves ritualized “cleansing” rites that can be as benign as meditation or as extreme as self-flagellation, drug-induced trance, or sexual orgies.

### Anti-Cybernetic Stance

To the Order, **cyborgs** and **AI** represent the height of impurity—metal defiling flesh, machines corrupting the human spirit. High-ranking members rarely use advanced technology (though ironically, the Order will still deploy advanced scanning or detection devices when “necessary,” calling it a “holy sacrifice” to achieve a higher cause).

## 3. Organization & Practices

### Public Ceremonies vs. Secret Rites

- **Open Services**: Friendly gatherings where the Order preaches unity, pacifism (at least outwardly), and the wonders of living unshackled by Tri-Core. These ceremonies may include communal singing, mild rituals, and moderate forms of “Sacrament” (often herbal or hallucinogenic concoctions).
- **Private Ceremonies**: Known only to initiates. Attendance typically demands unwavering loyalty. These rituals feature intense audio-visual stimuli—lights, music, dancing—combined with potent psychoactive “Sacraments.” Participants often report life-changing epiphanies, forging unshakeable devotion.
- **Indoctrination Techniques**: The Order has perfected psychological conditioning, creating fanatic loyalty (or “programmed faith”). Some “sleepers” may not even realize they serve the Order, only triggered by code words or special stimuli.

### Hierarchy: From Initiates to Elders

- **Lay Followers**: The bulk of the faithful—people disillusioned by the Commonwealth, the Syndicate, or general despair. They attend public gatherings, donate, and spread the faith informally.
- **Indoctrinated**: More dedicated members who’ve gone through multiple ceremonies, forming a fanatic or near-fanatic loyalty.
- **The Blessed**: Elite operatives who receive direct “Blessings of the Sensible”—biotech augmentations that transform them into terrifying biological weapons. They serve as the Order’s secret enforcers.
- **Elders of the Void**: Highest-ranking clergy who guard the original _Core of Existence_ and allegedly converse with the Sensible’s will. They coordinate global strategy, maintain alliances (or manipulations) with other factions, and decide who receives advanced blessings.


## 4. The Blessed & “Gifts of the Sensible”

### Biological Weaponry

Whereas the Syndicate and Commonwealth harness **cybernetic** enhancements, the Order invests in a microbe-based biotech infusion. It is said that the **Sensible** bestows these microbic “Blessings” upon chosen believers, rewriting their DNA and allowing them to reshape limbs into claws or hardened bone spikes. Some Blessed can extrude tendrils, sprout plated armor, or even release corrosive toxins.

- **Genetic Compatibility**: Only those with certain genetic markers survive the infusion. Many die during the process, but the Order conceals such failures.
- **Combat Doctrine**: The Blessed rely on stealth, hand-to-hand combat, and short-range brutality. Firearms are not forbidden outright, but the Order prefers the “purity” of organic weaponry.

### Psychological Profile

The more advanced a Blessed member becomes, the more “emotionless” or detached they often appear. Some remain outwardly warm and compassionate, but deeper analysis suggests they feel no real empathy. Their entire world becomes the Order’s mission.

## 5. Everyday Life & Indoctrination

### Who Joins the Order?

- **Ground Zone Residents & Free Port Citizens**: People cast out of stable Commonwealth enclaves, yearning for meaning or security.
- **Victims of the Bloody New Year**: Those traumatized by the collapse of utopian safety often blame AI or augmented soldiers for their suffering—prime recruitment targets for the Order.
- **General Malcontents**: Anyone resentful of AI’s oversight, Syndicate crimes, or incompetent local governance might see the Order as a righteous alternative.

### The Indoctrination Process

1. **Early Exposure**: Public ceremonies, social media interactions, or simple curiosity leads individuals to sample the Order’s mild forms of worship.
2. **Deepening Faith**: Repeated attendance intensifies the ceremonies—stronger “Sacraments,” mesmerizing group chanting, and personal “purity” counseling.
3. **Fanaticism**: Some become so enthralled that they abandon families, careers, or personal goals to serve the Order full-time. They cultivate hatred toward AI and cybernetics, increasingly dependent on the Order’s sense of belonging.
4. **Blessed Selection**: A rare few demonstrate unwavering loyalty and the right genetic makeup, ascending to the ranks of the Blessed through a series of injections and painful transformations.

## 7. Covert War Efforts

### Two Fronts: Public & Secret

- **Public Front**: The Order’s open worship, TV appearances, and philanthropic outreach (soup kitchens, orphan support, free medical tents). Its leaders speak of “peace,” “purity,” and “liberation from machines.”
- **Secret Front**: Covert operations led by Blessed assassins, infiltration squads, and black-market arms deals. They sabotage enemy institutions, gather intelligence, or instigate riots. Some infiltration involves advanced psychological subversion, even “sleeper agents” who appear normal until activated.

### Allies & Tools

- **Radical X**: Typically does the open fighting that the Order can’t be seen conducting itself.
- **Espionage & Sabotage**: The Order invests heavily in stealth kills and infiltration. Firearms are used sparingly to avoid drawing attention; biotech weaponry is considered a holy method to “purify.”

## 8. Looking Ahead

Whether the Order’s **Sensible** is a genuine cosmic entity, an alien intelligence, or a mythic fabrication remains a subject of intense debate. Nonetheless, the unstoppable rise in **Blessed** sightings and the cult’s infiltration of Free Ports and Ground Zones indicate it is more than a mere “religious curiosity.” In the eyes of the Commonwealth, the Order stands as a direct threat to global stability—rallying the masses against the Tri-Core, forging alliances with extremist groups, and harnessing frightening organic weaponry. For the devout faithful, however, the **Sensible** is a beacon of hope, promising redemption from a world suffocated by AI, capitalism, and what they see as soulless technology.
