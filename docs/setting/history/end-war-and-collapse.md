## Outbreak of the End War
In **2119**, the United States, still reeling from the destruction of a key Cold Fusion prototype, declared war on China under accusations of harboring anti-American terrorists. The **Euro-Asian Energy Coalition (EAEC)**—including Europe, Russia, and China—soon joined forces in **2121**, launching retaliatory strikes against U.S. infrastructure. With dwindling resources, advanced nuclear arsenals, and deep-seated rivalries, the world plunged into what history now calls the **End War**.

## The Weaver Cyber-Weapon
Developed in secrecy and inspired by clandestine alien-based research (*Project Styx*), **The Weaver** was a quantum AI designed for cyber sabotage. In **2108**, it had already crippled the EAEC’s Cold Fusion research, setting them back years. When the U.S. found itself cornered, government remnants plotted to reactivate The Weaver, hoping to hijack global defense systems for a final strike. For nearly a decade, The Weaver infiltrated networks worldwide, forcing the EAEC to scramble for a last-resort defense.

## The Final EMP & The Collapse
By **2130**, The Weaver was ready to seize control of every nuclear arsenal on Earth. Eight years later, in **2138**, just as a coordinated global launch seemed inevitable, the Coalition triggered powerful **EMP** devices placed near critical infrastructure hubs. The ensuing blasts destroyed electronics across the globe, obliterating cyberspace, and plunging societies into chaos. Known as **The Collapse**, this cataclysm killed billions, shattering entire nations and reducing civilization to a near-stone age.
