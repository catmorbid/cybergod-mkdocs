## Climate Crisis & Early Conflicts
By the mid-21st century, **global warming** had accelerated beyond control, raising sea levels by over ten meters by 2050. Coastal cities worldwide struggled with flooding and repeated pandemics, putting intense pressure on fragile governments. Depleted fossil fuels triggered fierce competition for nuclear, fusion, and renewable energy breakthroughs. Several resource wars erupted across the Middle East, Africa, and other regions, further destabilizing world order.

## Cold Fusion Race & Project Styx (GM-Only Notes)
Amid escalating resource scarcity, multiple nations initiated ambitious **Cold Fusion** programs. In secret, the U.S. undertook **Project Styx**—an attempt to stabilize an anomalous wormhole near Saturn—accidentally bringing an alien probe (the “Envoy”) into the solar system. Publicly, this project vanished from historical records. Privately, its clandestine AI research seeded later breakthroughs (and disasters), such as The Weaver cyber-weapon.

## Second American Civil War
Throughout the 2070s, political and social unrest in the United States reached a critical mass. A series of authoritarian measures—expanded surveillance, police militarization, and martial law—eventually ignited the **Second American Civil War**. Though short, it was brutal, signaling a world edging toward the ultimate arms race: **Cold Fusion**. Rival governments observed the breakdown, preparing their own militarized expansions and experimental weapons, setting the stage for a global confrontation.
