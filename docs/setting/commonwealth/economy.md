title: "Resource-Based Economy"

## Guiding Concepts
From the onset of the **Commonwealth**, leaders and visionaries sought to eliminate the profit-driven chaos that once fueled wars and inequality. Drawing on **Gaia**’s data analytics and **Themis**’s ethical framework, they envisioned a **resource-based** model: consumption and production are carefully measured, while basic living essentials remain accessible to all.

## Measuring Resources: RP & Basic Allowance
**Resource Points (RP)** form the backbone of the Commonwealth’s economy. A single citizen’s average monthly consumption is pegged to **100 RP**, covering food, housing, and other standard needs. This anchors every cost and wage within a single, transparent metric:

- **Monthly Allotments**  
  - Each Commonwealth citizen starts with a **Basic Allowance**—often around **50 RP**—enough for minimal subsistence.  
  - Individuals who work specialized or high-demand jobs receive extra monthly RP, placing most citizens between 50 and 150 RP each month.  
- **Dynamic Valuation**  
  - Every product or service is assigned an RP “price” based on resource inputs and environmental impacts.  
  - If demand spikes or supply falters, the Tri-Core (especially **Gaia**) recalibrates these RP costs in near-real time to discourage hoarding or wasteful consumption.

### Balancing Distribution & Responsibility
This model implies that each citizen sees a **resource statement** detailing how their monthly RP is spent—food, power usage, even AR/VR subscriptions. The Commonwealth’s official stance is that **transparency + data** fosters responsible consumption. Critics, however, argue the system can feel overly paternalistic, especially when outlying communities (e.g., **Ground Zones**) struggle to obtain stable RP allotments.

## Quantum Crypto Currencies (QC) & “Qubes”
Though the Commonwealth’s economy primarily functions via **RP**, a secondary form of currency called **Quantum Crypto Currencies (QC)** or “**qubes**” also circulates:

- **Anonymous & Portable**  
  - QC is stored in small data containers—nicknamed “**dice**” due to their geometric shapes. Each die holds a certain quantum-encrypted value.  
  - Transactions happen offline, bypassing official Commonwealth tracking, making QC function similarly to “cash” in pre-Collapse times.
- **Legal but Unofficial**  
  - The Commonwealth recognizes QC as a legal tender (i.e., not illegal), yet does **not** officially guarantee its stability.  
  - QC is popular in under-the-table deals, black markets, or **Syndicate**-controlled spaces that value anonymity.  

### Coexistence with RP
While an individual can purchase basic commodities entirely with RP, certain big-ticket or contraband purchases (like restricted implants) often require **QC** to mask identity or avoid oversight. This dynamic fosters tension: Commonwealth Regulators see qubes as a potential breeding ground for corruption, whereas Free Port dwellers hail QC as a life-saver in regions where RP alone cannot secure necessities.

## Inflation in Free Ports
Post–Bloody New Year (ref: history, bloody_newyear), **Syndicate**-dominated **Free Ports** parted ways with Commonwealth supply chains. RP valuations in these enclaves ballooned due to unstable resource flows:

- **Broken Distribution Loops**  
  - Without Gaia’s real-time adjustments, local councils struggle to maintain fair RP prices. Resource scarcities cause drastic swings, making the cost of everyday goods untenable.  
- **Rising Importance of QC**  
  - Facing runaway inflation, many Free Port residents resort to **qubes** for meaningful transactions. Local shops may accept partial RP plus some QC “dice” to finalize an exchange.

### Impact on Living Standards
While **RP** remains ingrained in day-to-day metrics (especially for measuring consumption and productivity), the average Free Port citizen can’t rely on it alone. Some juggle multiple methods of payment, flipping between inflated RP for state services and QC for black-market or real goods. Syndicate Agents exploit this dual-currency chaos to consolidate power.

## Societal Reflections & Future Outlook
Despite criticisms—especially around paternal oversight—the **Resource-Based Economy** stands as a defining pillar of the Commonwealth. It addresses former exploitative market systems and underscores the belief that **vital resources must not be commodified** purely by profit.

1. **Debates Over Security & Control**  
   - Some factions, like **Radical X**, denounce the entire RP system as another machine-led cage—pointing to black-market QC usage as proof the Commonwealth’s approach isn’t truly universal.  
   - The **Oversight Council** remains vigilant, ensuring Tri-Core policies on resource valuation maintain fairness, even if that means clashing with local authorities or Megacorp interests.

2. **Potential Reforms**  
   - Talks of integrating advanced nanotech verification to curb QC’s anonymity have sparked fierce pushback from privacy advocates.  
   - Syndicate and Free Port representatives demand more flexible policies, accusing the Commonwealth of interfering with local autonomy.

3. **Evolving State of Affairs**  
   - Gaian data suggests the resource-based system greatly reduces waste—an achievement rarely questioned. Yet the delicate balance between **RP**’s official standing and **QC**’s no-questions-asked allure reveals ongoing fault lines in a society that’s both highly regulated and inherently rebellious.

In a universe shaped by the Tri-Core’s watchful intelligence, **RP** ensures essential goods for every Commonwealth citizen, while **QC** thrives in the dark corners where rules—and loyalties—meet perpetual compromise. Whether this dual-system fosters adaptability or deepens cracks within the Commonwealth’s utopian veneer remains to be seen.
