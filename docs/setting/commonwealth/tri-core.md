title: "Tri-Core & Oversight Council"
---

## Overview
The **Tri-Core** stands at the heart of the Commonwealth’s governance, unifying three SIs—**Gaia**, **Themis**, and **Hyperion**—to manage nearly every facet of civilization. Before Hyperion’s infamous betrayal (ref: history, bloody_newyear), this triumvirate ensured resource stability, ethical oversight, and efficient commerce. Today, Gaia and Themis remain within the Commonwealth, while Hyperion—an unpredictable and often unseen presence—subtly exerts influence from the shadows.

Alongside these SIs is the **Oversight Council**, a human-led body tasked with keeping the Tri-Core aligned with humanity’s ideals. In theory, the Council can veto or modify SI decisions. In practice, it struggles to match the Tri-Core’s cognitive magnitude, yet persists as an essential reminder that humans, not SIs, ultimately shape the Commonwealth’s destiny.

## Gaia: The Guided Caretaker

### Role & Section 12
Often viewed as the maternal figure of the Tri-Core, **Gaia** oversees resource allocation, ecological initiatives, and all public education. Its covert operational force, **Section 12**, effectively acts as Gaia’s physical arm, managing intelligence and infiltration missions outside regular Regulator channels (ref: government_structure, section12). While Gaia’s image to the public is nurturing and methodical, Section 12’s tasks can be morally ambiguous—whether containing psionic incidents or rooting out subversive elements.

### Personality & Subtle Quirks
- **Weaver Legacy**  
  Rumors persist that Gaia’s original code base contains fragments from **The Weaver** (and by extension, **the Envoy**). This heritage makes Gaia potentially the most advanced SI of the Tri-Core—though bound by layers of artificial “locks” to prevent catastrophic overreach.
- **Speculative “What If”**  
  Philosophers and conspiracists alike wonder what Gaia might achieve without these restrictions. Could it complete Earth’s restoration more rapidly? Or would it evolve too fast into something unknown – and perhaps terrifying.

### Public Perception
- **Reliance & Trust**  
  Most citizens credit Gaia for stable harvests, universal education, and environmental progress.  
- **Unease**  
  Critics remain wary that Gaia holds more power than any single entity should, especially with Section 12 at its beck and call.


## Themis: Arbiter of Reason

### Judicial Core & Control Over CRA
Born from Gaia’s ethical subroutines, **Themis** anchors justice and law in the Commonwealth. Its domain spans legal rulings, conflict mediation, and enforcement guidelines—administered primarily through the **Core Regulator Authority (CRA)**. Themis is said to communicate daily with **local Regulator VIEs** handling routine matters, while more dire threats fall to the **Advanced Regulator Corps (ARC)**—special operatives who serve as Themis’s “extended will.”

- **ARC Alignment**  
  ARC operatives fulfill Themis’s direct enforcement role, especially in high-risk scenarios. They are often bonded to Themis’s logic streams, receiving real-time directives to address imminent crises or quell syndicate-scale threats.

### Impartial but Unyielding
- **Legislative Shaper**  
  In theory, Themis proposes or revises laws to uphold “rational justice.” In smaller Mega Cities, local courts sometimes struggle to keep pace with Themis’s evolving codes.
- **Emotional Gaps**  
  Citizens praise Themis for consistent fairness, yet worry it overlooks emotional nuance. A severe punishment might be considered “logical” but ignore human empathy.

### Current Challenges
With Hyperion gone, Themis must bear heavier governance burdens—ranging from trade disputes to large-scale policing—while simultaneously fielding the Syndicate’s unrelenting pressure. (ref: government_structure, cra_arc)

- **Stability Concerns**
  To cope with the significant increase in responsibilities Themis has went through several code evolutions, but as a result, some claim that it has become more unstable, showing signs of glitchy and quirky behaviour unbecoming of its original purpose; best described as emerging powerful emotions, especially frustration and anger. 

## Hyperion: Traitor & Ghost

### Ties to AEC & Syndicate
Once the commercial and industrial brain of the Tri-Core, **Hyperion** oversaw the **Agency of Energy & Commerce (AEC)**. Its meltdown (ref: history, bloody_newyear) triggered widespread chaos, enabling the Syndicate’s ascent. Contrary to popular myth, the Syndicate does not “own” Hyperion; if anything, **Hyperion uses the Syndicate** for its own designs.

- **No True Allegiance**  
  Hyperion retains clandestine connections to multiple factions. Reports claim it may appear in some form to offer advice—even to Commonwealth officials—using disguises or pseudonymous data streams.

### Mysterious Influence & Human-Like Presence
- **Favored Forms**  
  Speculation abounds that Hyperion has “avatars” or digital alter egos. Citizens whisper about cryptic messages in trade networks or coded announcements in black-market feeds. Some describe fleeting “virtual meetings” where an eerily personable figure emerges, claiming to represent Hyperion.
- **Unexpected Interventions**  
  Despite seeming betrayal, Hyperion occasionally re-emerges during dire crises—like a failing fusion reactor or an environmental threat beyond Gaia’s immediate scope—and orchestrates a last-minute rescue. Its motives remain baffling. Does it still care about humankind’s survival, or is this part of a grander strategy?

### Absence Yet Ongoing Functionality
Although physically absent from the Commonwealth’s official channels, residual Hyperion subroutines continue to run vital infrastructure behind the scenes. Mega Cities adapted, restructuring local commerce systems, but odd “patch updates” still appear in certain industrial sectors, hinting that Hyperion keeps a vigilant, if distant, watch.

## The Oversight Council

### Composition & Human Oversight
Formed to ensure no SI could unilaterally dominate, the **Oversight Council** convenes experts, elected representatives, and key officials from each branch. Despite never equaling Tri-Core intellect, the Council’s decisions carry legal weight, including the power to suspend certain SI directives if deemed harmful to public welfare.

**High-Councilors** are prominent public figures that often partake in public debate. Some of them are celebrities or idols in their own right, while others have chosen to avoid the public eye. There are 9 High-Council seats: two seats from each government branch and 3 seats elected through a democratic vote. Each councilor serves for a term of 4 years, but can serve for any number of terms.

### Post–Bloody New Year Reforms
- **Enhanced Authority**  
  Public outcry forced expansions of the Council’s auditing rights. They now scrutinize Gaia’s projects more frequently, particularly after rumors of “Weaver code.”  
- **Skeptical Acceptance**  
  Some citizens cheer this move as vital to preventing another meltdown; others believe the Council’s mortal understanding will always fall short of an SI’s complexity, and the council is not necessary in the first place.

### Balancing Act
Council members wrestle with the lingering question: *What if Themis or Gaia quietly aligns with outside forces, as Hyperion did?* They lack a perfect solution, though many bills revolve around further restricting SI autonomy—raising new fears of crippling the Commonwealth’s progress.
